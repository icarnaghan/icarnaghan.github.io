      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlike search engines that rank pages on the basis of various factors, Social networking portals display posts in groups and on pages in first-in-last-out order. If the page is old, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to scroll down the group until you find it. If the title of the post is interesting, people will share the post on their profiles or in groups they&amp;rsquo;ve joined. Such pages are called viral posts. They have the potential of bringing a large amount of traffic to a website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A project I was recently working on had in place a cloud-based infrastructure thatÂ was designed to support a single installation of the Drupal CMS running in Amazon Web Services (AWS). This infrastructure included an auto-scaling setup with load balancers hosting a &amp;lsquo;cache&amp;rsquo; layer and an &amp;lsquo;application&amp;rsquo; layer that hosted the Drupal CMS. On the backend tier, an AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) provided the MySQL database needed for the application. There were other components of the infrastructure such as our shared services for continuous integration, monitoring and development tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you don&amp;rsquo;t remove the no-indexed posts from the sitemap, search engines might crawl the posts even though they&amp;rsquo;re not relevant to your site. If you want Googlebot or Bingbot to crawl only the important pages on your site, follow the below two steps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If yourÂ site is getting good traffic, and if a new version of the plugin you&amp;rsquo;re using has been launched, you&amp;rsquo;ll have the following two questions in the mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will the plugin break your site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the plugin worth installing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the plugins are thoroughly tested before launch, it may have some bugs. If you install the update, your site may crash or it may add HTML code which may affect your site&amp;rsquo;s ranking in Google or Bing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/how-to-disable-or-noindex-wordpress-attachment-pages/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Attachment page is the built-in feature of WordPress. When these pages are not handled correctly by the website owner, Google and other search engines will index them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress attachments are thin pages that don&amp;rsquo;t add any value to a blog. These pages should be used only on personal or photography blogs wherein you want the visitors to comment on the pictures, videos, and other media files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide an option to turn off or disable these pages. However, you can use third-party plugins to manage them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/lessons-learned-using-drupals-domain-access-module/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months my team has been developing microsites to accompany our main website. The requirements for these sites included having their own domain, theme and separate content. After reviewing options in Drupal 7, I decided the best approach given our situation was to use the Domain Access Module. The Domain Access Module provides a very solid and powerful framework for developing additional sites within your existing Drupal CMS, but it can also be somewhat complicated to setup for any given use case. I have documented some of the lessons learned over the last few months as we implemented Domain Access in our own project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though I have a technical background, I was not comfortable in moving my sites during my initial days of online career. At that time, 2 of my biggest worries were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorrect site configuration can lead to tons of soft 404 or 404 errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If DNS isn&amp;rsquo;t configured correctly, search bots and visitors would fail to access my sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my online journey in May 2013. I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my hosting platform and moved my websites several times in the last four years without losing website traffic. Right now, my websites are hosted on an unmanaged Linode cloud server. Before switching to Linode, I used Digital Ocean. To move my sites, I follow the below steps:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There are a couple of plugins that enable you to move settings from AIOSEO to Yoast. Unfortunately, none of the plugins provide an option to bulk move noindex posts. People noindex posts to recover from Google quality updates or prevent penalty during an algorithm update.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A directory site has a massive listing of businesses. If a site is successful, it will have a listing of 1000+ business. A small site may have fewer listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEO plays a key role in deciding the fate of a directory site. A well-optimized website will rank high in search engines. A good example of this is Yelp, a large restaurant directory site that ranks at number 1 position in Google SERPs for several 1000 keywords. We must not forget that Yelp has 100s of employees working 24 x 7.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best way to Auto Tag WordPress posts</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/best-way-to-auto-tag-wordpress-posts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress tags are important, no matter howÂ small or large a site is. Tags allow users to group posts. They make website navigation easier. They allow search engines to discover and index new posts quickly. WordPress Related posts plugins use tags to calculate post relevancy and display related articles below blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings make mistakes. Sometimes, a webmaster may delete an important tag unintentionally. Once a tag is removed, the structure of the related post on your site may change. If you have a small blog with 10 to 20 posts, readding tags manually shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem. If you own a large site, readding tags to posts is an annoying task. The best way to add tags to blog posts is to use Automatic Post Tagger WordPress plugin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A theme is responsible for the success of a blogger. Many bloggers end up buying a theme which looks attractive but scores 0 when it comes to SEO. Despite publishing high-quality content on their sites, these bloggers don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy success and they quit blogging&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a newbie blogger, I had committed a huge mistake of trusting a third class theme developer. The developer rolled out an update which created the dreaded duplicate title, meta description problem on my site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is the best WordPress permalink structure for SEO?</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/what-is-the-best-wordpress-permalink-structure-for-seo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress saves the permalink of the page/post in aÂ database table. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t generate them on the fly. Hence, you can change the structure of the post/page URL anytime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should avoid changing permalinks often because it complicates your site. When you change the URL structure, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to redirect the old URL to the newer URL with a proper HTTP status code. If you don&amp;rsquo;t implement the redirect correctly, your site&amp;rsquo;s traffic from search engines will decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The block must have the shortcode or code to display the required widget. It is the 2nd line of our code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Widgets are one of the most impressive and powerful features of the WordPress content management system. They make your website look attractive and user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you install WordPress, the CMS will add up to 10 different widgets to your blog or website. These widgets have limited functionality. Furthermore, they&amp;rsquo;re not customizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free themes may not add new widgets to your WP site. To add a new widget, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to install a new WP plugin. As a blogger, you should know that too many plugins may slow down your website. If the plugin is badly programmed, it will lead to high server resource consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You may have seen top search engines such as Google or Bing showing star ratings in the search results of its pages. Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t show the ratings for all websites. It shows ratings only for the portals having schema markups and in-depth content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing the content is up to the user, but one can easily add schema codes to their site by referring the official guidelines. Modern content management systems provide extensions to add review boxes to their site and add the Schema markup code for the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I encountered this error yesterday while trying to upload a picture in my latest blog post. The picture uploader tool was repeatedly throwing cannot upload error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I logged into the server and checked PHP error log files generated by the website and PHP web server. The files were clean. I checked WP memory limit in the wp-config.php file. The memory allocated to my site was 64 megabytes and all my sites were using 15% of the allocated system memory. Hence, I ruled out the low memory issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like the Blue screen of death error, the WSOD is the most commonly reported error. The white screen problem occurs because of few lines ofÂ code crashing the entire application. Experienced programmers can fix the issue in a few minutes. If a novice user who hired aÂ freelancer or uses a content management system sees theÂ white screen, he should follow the below two methods to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wsod-in-sites-other-than-cms&#34;&gt;WSOD in sites other than CMS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see the white screen of death, the first thing you should do is check log files. Unless you change the path of log files in the server&amp;rsquo;s config file, the web and DB server creates log files in the /var/ directory in Linux. In most of the cases, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the root cause problem for the WSOD problem in these files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two of the best plugins for email marketing and having regular visitors are OptinMonster and SumeMe.Â SumoMe is an ideal tool for the users looking for an all-in-one plugin for improving traffic, adding new subscribers, etc. OptinMonster is a great plugin for creating Opt-ins of various types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two plugins are great for users who don&amp;rsquo;t want to waste time in customization. They provide predefinedÂ templates which you can use right away on your website. In case you&amp;rsquo;re finding it confusing to choose between OptinMonster and SumoMe, go through the below paragraphs where we have explained the similarities and differences between the 2 most popular plugins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress is a great content management system because it allows users to launch a new self-hosted blog or website within half an hour. Launching a site is easy but you&amp;rsquo;ll not make money with it if the siteÂ doesn&amp;rsquo;t get decent traffic from search engines. To make sure that the site is SEO friendly, you must write good quality content, buy a good hosting plan, and purchase a premium theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SEO is not a child&amp;rsquo;s play. One wrong settingÂ can impact search engine rankings dramatically. Although WordPress is a decade old CMS and powers millions of sites, it is still suffering from various SEO issues. To fix the problem, the must install one of the 100s of SEO plugins available in the WordPress repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should not install plugins which have poor ratings and promise plenty of features. I did the same mistake in the past and I still regret it.Â In the year 2013, my site lost 90 to 95% organic traffic because of a bad WordPress SEO plugin. Today, the best SEO plugins provide plenty of useful features. They let users optimize their site for higher local search rankings, add breadcrumbs to the website, add XML sitemaps, etc. Moreover, they work great.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Preparing for the Acquia Certified Developer Exam Drupal 8</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Acquia Certified Developer exam Drupal 8 just launched a couple of months ago. I was interested in studying for this exam as I have been working in Drupal 8 for the last six months and future projects look most likely to be Drupal 8 based. I had looked at the various Acquia certification tracks in the past, however I was never fully committed to the Drupal 7 track so I was happy when Acquia announced first the FoundationsÂ and then later the Certified Developer exams.Â I took the Foundations exam first and found that while I was weaker in my front-end Drupal 8 skills, I managed to pass. Later when I sat for the Certified Developer exam I realized there was a bit of cross over in terms of the questions, in fact I think a few of them were taken directly from the foundations exam. I would recommend anyone considering the Certified Developer exam to first take Foundations as it will give you a good idea of the type of questions to expect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dependency Injection Service Container Example</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/dependency-injection-service-container-example/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an earlier post, I outlined the basics of dependency injection and talked a little bit about the Drupal 8 service container and how we can use this in our code. Day 16 of Drupal Activity Cards provides a task for us to implement dependency injection in one of the Drupal 8 Example modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples module is a great resource for developers getting started in Drupal coding. The modules included gives usÂ basic functionality that provides easy to followÂ starting points for a number of different needs. For our dependency injection example we are going to look at page_example, a simple module for generating a Drupal 8 page via a controller. A function called simple() returns a basic page. We are going to extend this function to provide a log entry every time a use visits this page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Logging is very important in any production site because we don&amp;rsquo;t have the same ability to debug code that we have in our development environments. Drupal 7 had a very robust logging system called watchdog(), which has been replaced by logger in Drupal 8. This post summarizes a basic use case for logging in Drupal 8 continuing the Drupal 8 Activity Cards series on Day 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amber Matz breaks down logging in Drupal 8 concisely inÂ How to Log Messages in Drupal 8. In her article, she breaks down the code needed to implement logger and provides solid explanations. The examples provided involve procedural coding in the .module file as does the example I provide in this article. If you are writing controllers or forms that extend ControllerBase or FormBaseÂ then it would be better to use the service container to inject logger into your code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 has a new theme engine, however many of the concepts we are familiar with in Drupal 7 are still in place in this new version. Themes still have the same ability to overwrite various templates within core, only now instead of modifying .tpl.php files, you will be creating Twig files in their place. Theme functions are still available to use, however they are now kept in the .theme file instead of template.php. Other changes worthy ofÂ exploring in more depth are briefly summarized below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 has seen a lot of improvements for content entities and with the new Drupal console, setting up a content entity has been made a lot easier with the addition of boilerplate code generation. Day 11 of the Drupal 8 Activity Card set focuses on content entities, how they can be setup in Drupal 8, how we might add our own custom fields to the boilerplate code provided, and how this is managed within the Drupal 8 administration system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Configuring your Local Drupal 8 Development Environment</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/configuring-your-local-drupal-8-development-environment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have struggled with properly optimizing my local environment in terms of enabling debugging and disabling cache for a while. There isn&amp;rsquo;t that many steps you need to cover in order to have a proper working development environment. After reviewing Day 10 I completed setting up my environment the correct way and have outlined this in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-enable-settingslocalphp&#34;&gt;Step 1 Enable settings.local.php&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy and RenameÂ /sites/settings.example.local.php -&amp;gt; /sites/default/settings.local.php&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncomment the following lines in your settings.php file:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-php&#34; data-lang=&#34;php&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# if (file_exists(__DIR__ . &amp;#39;/settings.local.php&amp;#39;)) {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;#   include __DIR__ . &amp;#39;/settings.local.php&amp;#39;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-2-disable-cache-services&#34;&gt;Step 2 Disable Cache Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your sites/default/settings.local.php file, uncomment the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-php&#34; data-lang=&#34;php&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# $settings[&amp;#39;cache&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;bins&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;render&amp;#39;] = &amp;#39;cache.backend.null&amp;#39;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebuild your site configuration by visiting yoursite.local/rebuild.php&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-3-disabletwig-cache-and-enable-debugging&#34;&gt;Step 3 DisableÂ Twig Cache and Enable Debugging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the following lines to your /sites/development-services.yml (Refer to /sites/default/default-services.yml for all options)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-php&#34; data-lang=&#34;php&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;twig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;auto_reload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear Cache and then verify Twig debugging has been enabled by refreshing your Drupal 8 homepage. Review your source code and you should see something similar to:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-php&#34; data-lang=&#34;php&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;THEME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;DEBUG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;THEME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;HOOK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;html&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;NAME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;SUGGESTIONS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;front&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;twig&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;--.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;twig&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;twig&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twig debugging gives a lot of helpful information scattered throughout your source code in the form of comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Attaching JS and CSS Assets in Drupal 8</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/attaching-js-and-css-assets-in-drupal-8/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 has introduced a different way of attachingÂ JavaScript and CSS to themes and custom modules via a new concept called libraries, which are covered inÂ Day 9. Libraries are essentially .yml files that define different groups of assets that can later be attached via module code. When I started working with the theme layer in Drupal 8, I quickly realized that certain things are very different from Drupal 7. One of the main gotchas for anyone new to Drupal 8 is the idea that JavaScript libraries are now only loaded where they are needed. In contrast to Drupal 7 where jQuery for example, was loaded on every page, in Drupal 8 jQuery is no longer automatically loaded. This provides for a better optimized site with only the required libraries included in areas that they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of new terminology in Drupal 8 and for anyone not familiar with Object Oriented programming, some of it can be downright confusing. For myself, I have worked with OOP for quite a while, however I have not spent as much time writing custom modules for Drupal 7. While I am familiar on the surface with the hook system and API at a very novice level, I have never really had to do any intense back end development in D7. Now that I am working in Drupal 8, things are quite different with my projects at work. Thankfully my OOP background has filled in some of the gaps, however my lack of Drupal 7 module development knowledge has proven to be a burden.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 7 focuses mainly on the Drupal Queue API. The main resource for this card is an article calledÂ Drupal 8 Queue API â Powerful Manual and Cron Queueing, which I had referenced in an earlier post. Before completing any of the materials, I had no previous experience with the Queue API, nor hook_entity_insert, which was used to create a demo queue system in the referenced article. After going through the article I gained a better understanding of how the queue system works. At a high level the following steps outline the process of constructing the module that is documented in this article along with relevant links to the API.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For several years I have worked as an ASP.NET MVC developer and have become intimately familiar with terms such as services and dependency injection and services. It is refreshing to see some of these familiar concepts surfacing in Drupal 8. Day 6 focuses mainly on introducing us to services and dependency injection via several online resources. There is no exercises or tasks in this card as the aim is to simply gain an understanding of some of these concepts. I saw a lot of overlap in terms of syntax and how dependency injection is handled in Drupal 8 compared with Unity and StuctureMap in ASP.NET, so anyone from background or other traditional object oriented languages such as Java will be familiar with a lot of this. I have outlined the main takeaways I got from the Day 6Â below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Drupal 8 Migration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had some exposure to the migrate module in the past, mostly with Drupal 7 and more recently for a Drupal 8 migration project that required importing of a small (under 1000) set of records stored in a CSV file. Todays D8Card focuses on the new migration module that comes partly with core and also partly in the form of contributed modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;migrate-core--migrate-contrib&#34;&gt;Migrate Core &amp;amp; Migrate Contrib&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of todays set of tasks was to import a couple of small CSV files using migrate and some of the contributed modules. I started out by reviewing the links posted in the card and then proceeded to download and install migrate_tools,Â migrate_plus, andÂ migrate_source_csv.Â What comes with Drupal 8 core out of the box is pretty limited and only contains migration functionality for moving content from previous Drupal sites. It definitely makes the upgrade process less painful, however if you want to get into migration code that can manage a multitude of external sources, then you will want to grab to contrib modules above.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among the many changes in Drupal 8, the blocks system received an overhaul, which has improved much of its functionality significantly. Some of the most notable take aways include the new block page layout and UI for updating, adding, and editingÂ blocks, the addition of custom blocks and fieldable types (similar to content types), and integration with display view modes to allow for rendering changes based on block placement. Day 5Â directs you to a good introductory video of the new blocks system by the Drupalize.me team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Day 3 we are starting to accelerate in terms of skills developed by the cards. This card has us create our first Drupal 8 module, learn about Drupal 8 Form API and learn about the Configuration API. The card starts off with directing you to several Drupal.org documentation pages including Creating a Custom Page, Â Defining and using your own configuration in Drupal 8,Â Providing Default configuration, and Simple Configuration API. Except for the Creating a Custom Page document, everything else here is focused on giving you a solid overview of the configuration system within Drupal 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have to be honest, before completing Day 2Â tasks, I had never actually used the Paragraphs module before. I heard others mention it in the past and considered looking at it at some point, however until today I did not realize what I was missing in terms of the power and flexibility that this module has to offer. The d8cards.com Paragraphs Module card begins with directing you to YouTube tutorial by Zane Sensenig, embedded below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-21-day-challenge&#34;&gt;THE 21 DAY CHALLENGE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâve been trying to learn Drupal 8 for the last couple of months as I was landed in the middle of a D8 project at work. Being involved on the project has taught me a lot about Drupal 8 module development and Symfony in general, however I have started questioning the way I am writing code and if in fact it is the best way or the âDrupalâ way. I decided I needed some additional exposure to Drupal 8, not only in terms of module development, but as a platform in its entirety including front-end, configuration as well asÂ back-end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I come from a .NET background where I was spoiled by the ease of use and integration of Visual Studio. Recently much of my development work has moved to the open source and the world of Drupal 8 where I have gotten by until recently with Sublime Text and Atom. Since I have started writing custom modules, I needed a way to effectively debug my code and I had heard good things about the PHP debugger Xdebug.Â Unfortunately it can be a little tricky to setup, so I have outlined the basic steps I needed to go through using my favorite Vagrant environment Scotchbox. If you are unfamiliar with Scotchbox, check out my earlier postsÂ Scotchbox Vagrant LAMP Stack andÂ DrupalÂ DevelopmentÂ EnvironmentÂ inÂ lessÂ than 10Â Minutes&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to compress or minify HTML of a WordPress site?</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/how-to-compress-or-minify-html-of-a-wordpress-site/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minification is a process of stripping whitespaces and comments of a page. When you minify a web page, the visitors to your website will experience faster browsing experience on their desktop or mobile device. The page speed insights tool will not request you to minify HTML, JS, or CSS code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you minify HTML, CSS or JS code on your website, the server will send a small page to the client. The file size is yet another factor in determining the page speed of a website. The browser on the client device will download a smaller file faster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using Scotchbox for a while now and continue to be impressed by it&amp;rsquo;s simplicity and ease of use compared to other Vagrant environments I have used in the past. Recently I started working on a Drupal 8 project that required the use of a PostGreSQL (PostGres) database. Thankfully, when I checked the Scotchbox 2.0 documentation, it appeared that PostGres came packaged up with the environment and ready to use. After doing a little bit of research I realized I needed to follow a couple of steps in order to get this running properly with a PostGres client. I am outlining the steps below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google makes sure that the site which the user is about to visit is clean. It displays a warning message for the websites which are not safe. One of the most common messages that a search engine user see is &amp;ldquo;This site may be hacked&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search engine will show this message in the search results in one of the below cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;malicious-code-in-web-pages&#34;&gt;Malicious code in web pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hacker may have inserted a malicious code in the web pages. When Google comes across this codeÂ and finds it suspicious, your site willÂ be flagged as hacked. You can use the free AW Snap tool to find malicious pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A blog post is incomplete without images. Imagine if a site has no photos, will you spend your time going through the content?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A visitor to your website might be impressed with the picture you&amp;rsquo;ve embedded in the blog post. He may want to share the image on social networks. Some users may not waste their time in copying the photo URL by right clicking on the page. They may exit your website and use Google image search to get a link to the picture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Affiliate links are ugly and long. When the user hovers your mouse on an affiliate link and finds your tracking code in the URL, he may not click the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not a seasoned webmaster, you should use a plugin to create and manage affiliate links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GoCodes was one of the best affiliate link Cloaker plugins. I was using it until I update the PHP on my VPS server. Unfortunately, the plugin has become useless because it has not been updated for 2 years. GoCodes will not work on sites using the latest version of PHP because several functions that GoCodes uses have been deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s not only the core that gets regular updates, but plugins and theme developers also publish latest versions of their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WP-CMS, themes, and plugins get better with every new release.Â Only the folks who workÂ at Automattic INC know when WordPress update will be released. When a developer releases a newer version of his/her theme or plugin, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a notification for the same in the WP dashboard. The big problem with WordPress is that users will have to update their plugins, core files, and theme manually.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1000s of WordPress websites are hacked every day because the hackers are aware of the security loopholes in plugins and themes that the website is using. Usually, the websites that use outdated or nulled WordPress plugins and themes fall prey to hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are incidents where websites that use powerful WordPress security plugins are hacked. To keep your WordPressÂ website or blog safe, you must back up the database and images on regular basis.

&lt;p&gt;The theme will have clean code and it will be search engine and mobile friendly. Unfortunately, the premium theme which I used earlier on this blog was a waste of my money. I had bought it when I was a newbie blogger after reading a review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme was good initially, but the developer removed its inbuilt review system. When I asked the development team why they did so? They asked me to wait for a few weeks because they&amp;rsquo;ll be launching a review plugin. It has been 5 months now, the plugins have not been released yet. All my reviews and the schema start rating markups were gone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress saves the post, settings and other data related to your website in an MSQL database. The DB is handled by the user through CMS with a DB management plugin or through a command line terminal from a remote computer (on unmanaged hosting environment).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before buying any product from a website or before contacting a business, search engine users will go through the reviews. If the reviews are negative, the user may not communicate with the business or he&amp;rsquo;ll leave the website without making any purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers are the best people to judge a product and the best way to get their feedback is by adding a review section to the website. Reviews may help in improving the rankings of a website as it may have many new keywords.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The plugin works 24 x 7 to update the DB with visitor data. You can use it to compare website traffic from the best search engines i.e. Google, Bing, Baidu, Yandex, DuckDuckGo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The font is one of the most critical elements on a website. Developers make sure that the typography of their website is best in class. If your visitor finds that your site is ugly, he&amp;rsquo;ll leave it immediately without reading the content or making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 100s of fonts that you can use for free, but you will have to spend a lot of time in searching for them unless you use Google web fonts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The sidebar is one of the most critical section of a website. It not only helps in improving the revenue of a site by allowing users to place adverts above the fold but also helps in decreasing the bounce rate. On WordPress blogs, you&amp;rsquo;ll find banners, related/latest/popular post&amp;rsquo;s widget on the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content you add to the sidebar will be visible on all posts. If there are 1000 posts on your website, each and every advertisement or URL you&amp;rsquo;ll add as a widget will be displayed on each post. You may have grouped your posts in many categories. Suppose there are four categories on your website - phones, laptops, tablets, and desktop. Imagine you&amp;rsquo;ve published an article on a notebook.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;For the best experience of the search bot and user, it is important that we fix the reported error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Change Image Size in Post Content WordPress?</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/how-to-change-image-size-in-post-content-wordpress/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you may not like your current WordPress theme, and you may think of replacing it with some other template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Themes allow you to export settings. But the settings you back up will be compatible only with the theme i.e. You can&amp;rsquo;t move settings of a Mythemshop template to TagDiv NewsPaper or Elegant Themes Divi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you change your template, you may have to tweak the design for the best experience of the user. You may also have to change image sizes so that the blog posts don&amp;rsquo;t look horrible or broken.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know how easy it is to create a contact form page in WordPress. If not, then you might be a newbie who should explore the WordPress plugins repository.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook allows the webmasters to add the Facebook comment form, like box or the page feed to their websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In WordPress CMS, adding a comment form or the like box is easy, but inserting a page feed is usually a tricky task for a webmaster. Even if the user manages to add FB feed to the sidebar, he won&amp;rsquo;t be able to customize it unless the user knows the working knowledge of CSS. In such cases, the user should use the free custom Facebook feed plugin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress supports taxonomies. In the WP CMS (content management system), the user can create as many tags and categories as they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A category is different from a tag. It is used to build a menu. If you create a treemap of WordPress structure, then the categories will always be the child of index or root page. They make navigation easier for the search bots and the visitors. On a small blog or a website, the webmaster should create only a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Plugins to add 2 step authentication to WordPress website</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/plugins-to-add-2-step-authentication-to-wordpress-website/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dual factor authentication has become one of the most important security features in the last few years. Major websites like Google Mail, Outlook, Facebook are now protecting user accounts in a better way by allowing them to use a mobile device as their identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To activate 2 step authentication, the service provider will ask you to install Google Authenticator app (or any of its alternative). Some websites will ask you to verify the mobile phone number so that the authentication service will send a 4 or 5 digit code when required. This code will be used for one-time verification, and it will be valid only for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to website designing, the User Experience plays a crucial role. If a site is not user-friendly, the conversions and revenue will be flat unless most of your earnings come from Adsense or its alternative advertising platform. This applies to all websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good way to make sure that your website is effectively generating revenue and the user visits more than one pages of your site, you should add the call to action buttons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On many established blogs, you&amp;rsquo;ll find related or recommended articles in post content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posts are embedded in a stylized &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; or &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; and they attract visitor&amp;rsquo;s attention. They&amp;rsquo;re known as inline related posts (IRP). IRPs, when placed at the right position can reduceÂ the bounce rateÂ of a blog. They can also increase the page-views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established websites have enough revenue to hire a WordPress developer who can write the code to insert content hyperlinks inline of the post automatically after the post has been published.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress is claimed to be one of the most secure content management systems of the decade, but you need to take some precautions while using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The login page is accessible to everyone using the Internet. To access the page, the user has to enter example.com/wp-login.php simply. If you&amp;rsquo;re using a weak password, then a software or a bot can easily hack your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some hackers will target your site with a DOS or DDOS attack. If your hosting provider has not set up a firewall for your account, your website and web server will be down. If the site has many visitors, you&amp;rsquo;ll lose some revenue. If the access to the wp-config file is not restricted, the hacker will get your database name and its password.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I felt the need to install a new third party plugin for inserting advertisements to my blog. My favorite plugin i.e. Quick Adsense has not been updated for over 1.5 years, and it has become unreliable because it has not been tested with latest WordPress versions. I searched the WordPress repository to find a reliable and frequently updated plugin for insert adverts. After a few minutes, I found Advanced ads. I was tempted to try out the plugin after going through its ratings and reviews shared by the real users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Creating a backup of the database is practiced in all the top organisations. For webmasters who work online, it&amp;rsquo;s the most important thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All websites are prone to hacking. Hackers are always in search of a security loophole in a website. When they find one, they&amp;rsquo;ll deface it by changing the index file. Hackers locate the site configuration file stored on the servers to find database password so that they can access the database.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The default WordPress search module is useful, but not the best. No matter what keyword or term you search for, you&amp;rsquo;ll not be satisfied with the results generated by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This module is critical because people use it to find relevant information on your site. It can also reduceÂ the bounce rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the WordPress content management system supports hierarchical pages (categories, tags, authors, attachment pages) that make navigation easy for the visitor, it is always a good decision to add a powerful search function to your blog. Thankfully, we don&amp;rsquo;t have to write PHP code for the same. There are a lot of free WordPress search plugins available for download. But the below two plugins are the best and most powerful among them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Displaying popular posts in blog sidebar is useful in many ways. As your top articles are posted, the link juice aka page rank will transfer to them which in turn will help your posts rank higher in search engines like Google, Bing,Â etc. Adding a widget for the same is a good way of strengthening the internal link structure of your website. If your top posts have affiliate links, displaying them in the sidebar will boost your income and conversions. There are a lot of popular post widgets and plugins but the one which I&amp;rsquo;ve shared today is what you&amp;rsquo;re probably looking for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although W3TC has options to configure Memcache and OPCacheÂ modules, this plugin requires some configuration to work according to your expectations.

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve purchased a VPS package from Hostgator, Bluehost or any other hosting provider, you should try out WP-FFPC.Â The highlighting feature of this pluginÂ is that it supports various types of web servers and lacks complex features. You can easily run it on NGINX, LightHTTPD, Apache 2 platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The default WordPress commenting system is good, but some people may want to replace it with a third party plugin like Disqus, Livefyre for better control, spam protection, and administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disqus adds a lot of weight to your site, and you should think before using it. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen LiveFyre plugin on high traffic websites, and it looks great. I&amp;rsquo;ve not tested it. In case you&amp;rsquo;re searching for a Disqus or Livefyre alternative for your WordPress site, there&amp;rsquo;s a good new option available for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;ve installed a WordPress table plugin on your site. You have 1000 blog posts, and only 10 of them has a table. The Javascript and CSS files for the same will be inserted in the header section, and it will be called on all the pages even though you have not added a table. This increases the page size, and it can affect the page loading time. To solve this problem, you can either writeÂ a PHP code that will insert CSS and JS scripts in the site header only when required or you can install WordPress plugin organizer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When a lot of users are commenting on your articles, you should make sure that the comments do not affect the load time of the page. If it is affecting posts load time, the user should enable pagination for the same by navigating to Settings&amp;mdash;&amp;gt; discussions page or he must search for an alternative solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my tech blog&amp;rsquo; posts was having over 150 comments from visitors. The post is well written and has 1500 words in it. Due to a large number of comments, the visitor had to scroll down for more than 10 seconds to navigate to the footer section of my site. The footer is the important section for me because it has links to contact me, privacy policy, disclaimer pages, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Caching is one of the most essential and advanced techniques for improving the performance of websites and reducing server resource usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites using this technology are fast, and they yieldÂ pretty good results when tested with GTmetrix or Pingdom tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress has been the backbone of many powerful and established websites with 1000s of posts. To make their sitesÂ more powerful, the user should install the best third party plugins (including a caching system).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/working-tips-to-reduce-cpu-usage-in-wordpress-shared-hosting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shared hosting plans are relatively cheap as compared to VPS or dedicated hosting. This is becauseÂ your site will be offered around 512MB RAM (or lower) and a CPU, which will be shared by many other websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites thatÂ are growing at a very fast rate should always be hosted on VPS servers (use dedicated if you require more RAM). If they&amp;rsquo;re hosted on Shared platform, their account might be suspended because of very high CPU usage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Databases like Oracle, MySql, PostgreSQL are designed to store data of the user securely. They&amp;rsquo;re fast and highly secure. Databases are the backbone of almost all types of web applications. Due to incorrect configuration or lack of maintenance, your site or application will slow down. In severe cases, it may also crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the major multinational companies, you&amp;rsquo;ll find DB Administrators who will take care of the data. The DBA guys work in shifts so that the firm&amp;rsquo;s applications are always running. If DB server is down, the revenue will be affected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/wordpress-x-theme-review-2018-fast-wp-template-with-great-features/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bloggers want a lot of features in their themes. They also expect their WordPress blogs and websitesÂ to load fast. Free templates have limited support and features. Thus, many of the bloggers buy a premium template. Before they make payment, the user willÂ explore 100s of available options. This task induces a headache and creates a lot of confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is a job for professional and experienced bloggers like me to make newbies or WordPress users aware of the top themes. Last week, we published a detailed review of Newspaper template. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ve discussed one of the most popular and powerful WordPress theme named X. No other WP template is as perfect and user-friendly as X.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coupon websitesÂ can be very profitable if you bring traffic to it.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Newspaper themes for WordPress are recommended for technology, travel, health, news, video and sports niche blogs. There are a lot of newspaper and magazine themes available for download in the wordpress.org directory. Most of them claim to be SEO friendly but unfortunately they&amp;rsquo;re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free themes have a major drawback that their support is limited. If you encounter any problems, you will have to post your query on WordPress.org forum. Most of the times, instead of the developers, other users will help you out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best WordPress sitemap plugins for better SEO (2018)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/best-wordpress-sitemap-plugins-for-better-seo-2018/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/best-wordpress-sitemap-plugins-for-better-seo-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A sitemap is one of the most important elements of a website. It is nothing but an XML document that features all the pages and post of your blog. ItÂ should be defined in a correct way. Failing to do so will confuse search engines and the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When users start a new blog, theyÂ should immediately create a sitemap and submit it to Google andÂ Bing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly Speaking, these two search engines are smart, and they can determine the structure of your site without a sitemap. But you should add this document to your site as it will be useful for the users (in case they&amp;rsquo;re Â looking for it).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/robots.txt-for-wordpress-useful-tips-and-settings-for-better-seo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google bot and other search spiders will visit the robots.txt file of your website immediately after they hit the htaccess file. Both these files are crucial as they can affect your site&amp;rsquo;s organic presence. Htaccess has rules to block IP addresses, redirect URLs, enable gzip compression, etc. The robots.txt will have a set of rules for the search engines. It has few lines that will either block or allow crawling of files and directories. Google has been penalizing blogs with thin content. If you&amp;rsquo;re a WordPress user, you should be aware of the taxonomies of the CMS. If you have generated many tags on your site, make sure that you make then no index as they&amp;rsquo;ll cause duplicate content issues on your blog. Don&amp;rsquo;t block them in the robots.txt file if you&amp;rsquo;ve enabled tags on single posts. If you don&amp;rsquo;t do this, page rank and link juice will be wasted. No index attribute for tags can be easily added via Yoast plugin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many self-proclaimed SEO experts believe that hiding WordPress date helps in improving search engine rankings. I supported their strategy until I started thinking more about user experience and rich snippets. If you&amp;rsquo;ve come across a post that claims to improveÂ SERP position after removing dates from the blog, you&amp;rsquo;re being misled. Google knows when you&amp;rsquo;ve published a blog post through the sitemap file that has both published/modified dates. So you can&amp;rsquo;t fool it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every content management system has a login page, and dashboard that allows bloggers and webmasters to manage the data published on their site and WordPress is no exception. This page is relevant. Thus it will always be on the attackÂ of website hackers that may/may not use automated program to gain access to your site&amp;rsquo;s dashboard. The default slug to log in to your WordPress dashboard is wp-login.php, and every hacker and WordPress user knows it knows it. Thus if you&amp;rsquo;re using the default password or if you&amp;rsquo;re using weak login credentials, your site might get easily hacked (You can remove the default user i.e., admin through the users page in WP).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;404 errors in WordPress is caused when a user or a search bot is not able to find a page on your site. This page might be linked from your blog post or another website. According to Google webmaster tools, these errors won&amp;rsquo;t affect your site&amp;rsquo;s performance in the search engine, but you should try to get rid of them for a better user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a lot of WordPress 404 errors can do more harm than any other factor. For example, the bounce rate will be very high as users didn&amp;rsquo;t find the page they wanted to access, they&amp;rsquo;ll hit the back button of the browser immediately without spending much time on your blog. Thus it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to get rid of 404 errors. You can use the below tips and plugins for the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have seen author bio widget below posts on many popular blogs. Bio section is important as it makes website users aware of the writer&amp;rsquo;s skills,Â hobbies, experience, etc. Just like about me, disclaimer, privacy policy pages, the bio section is one of the most usefulÂ elements of a WordPress site. Most WordPress themes include the author bio box and to displayÂ your information in it, navigate to your profile page by hovering your mouse cursor over users menu (This menu appears on the left side of your WordPress dashboard). If your theme lacks this widget, make sure that you install any of the below plugins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Backlinks from social networks like Facebook, Google plus, twitter, etc are nofollow. But you&amp;rsquo;ll be shocked to know that Google uses data from social networks to rank websites in the search engine regardless whether the link is dofollow or nofollow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone reads and article on your site and if he/she shares it in a group/page or on his public timeline, this link will be considered as a vote of trust. Thus, if your blog articles are shared 100s of time, there&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that your site will rank in the 1st 2 or 3 pages of Google. Making people share content is not a piece of cake. The user will not share your blog post unless he has a reason to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As WordPress content management system has a commenting and trackback system, it&amp;rsquo;s always on the target of spammers. Trackback links are added below the post content. A spammer who wants his website or YouTube videos to rank high in Google or Bing will drop useless comments with some URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re allowing dofollow backlinks, link juice will be transferred to the commentators website. To avoid this, install and activate the ultimate nofollow plugin on your blog. This plugin will allow you to convert all dofollow links in comments to nofollow. To block spam comments on your WordPress website, you install any of the below free plugins:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drupal can be installed on any number of environments, but since it was developed primarily to run onÂ an Apache server with PHP and MySQL database, it makes sense to mimic this environment as much as possible in a developmentÂ sandbox. There are LAMP applicationsÂ for both Windows (WAMP / XAMP) and Mac OS (MAMP) which can serve as a Linux replacement, however recent innovations with Virtual Machines and Vagrant means that we can re-create a more native environment for development quickly and easily. Below I will describe how you can setup Drupal using some of these tools in less thanÂ 10Â minutes. The Vagrant setup used here is Scotch Box. The objective is toÂ setup a Drupal developmentÂ environment with full LAMP stack capabilities including command line access and Drush integration using theÂ native Linux file system for speed and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to blogging and search engine optimization, no other on-page element is as important as title and meta descriptions. According to Google webmaster guidelines, every page on a WordPress blog must have unique meta description and title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t follow this guideline, your site won&amp;rsquo;t rank well in search engines, and if you&amp;rsquo;ve verified your blog with Google Webmaster tools, you&amp;rsquo;ll see duplicate tag warning in HTML improvements section of your GWT account. Meta description is one of the most important on-page elements as it is the first thing that a search engine users see (if your site appears in the search results) when they search for some information. If you&amp;rsquo;ve not added relevant keyword and a useful short information in this tag, theÂ user will not visit your blog. Meta description length should not be less or more than 170 characters, and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be stuffed with keywords.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Slideshows are attractive, aren&amp;rsquo;t they? Blogs with slideshows have a very less bounce rate, high level of user engagement and better conversion rate. Many webmastersÂ embed a picture slideshow in their sites. This makes users spend more time on theÂ sites which in turn increases its search engine rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use an online tool to create slides, there&amp;rsquo;s no better tool than SlideShare. This tool can generate slideshow code. Thus, you can easily embed your slideshowÂ on any blog/website. If you use this code, you will be wasting your page rank as the code will link your site to SlideShare without adding rel=&amp;ldquo;nofollow&amp;rdquo; attribute. The generated code will add an iframe to your site. Some search engines ignore the content in iframes. In such cases, you can use the best WordPress slideshow plugin, the Meta Slider. If you don&amp;rsquo;t use WordPress content management system, you can use a Jquery slideshow plugin. There are two main advantages of using the WPÂ plugin:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to move my WordPress site from one server to another a couple of times with 0 seconds downtime and no loss of traffic. For a newbie, the transfer process canÂ take almost an hour. For an experienced guy, the time will be reduced to 20 or 25 minutes. Migrating a WordPress site is impossible if you&amp;rsquo;re using a slow internet connection. So make sure that you&amp;rsquo;re a broadband user with a web speed of at least 1 or 2 MBPS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reducing jpg, png file size on self-hosted WordPress blogs will not only improve its load time but it will also increase the search engine rankings of your post. Google considers site speed as a ranking factor. There are two ways to reduce picture size before uploading to your blog. Install a standalone Windows or Linux software that will resize images or use a WP plugin. The 2nd option is better than the 1st. Ever since I started blogging, I used the WP-SmushItÂ plugin for the same. Last night, after updating the WP-smushItÂ plugin, I saw a message that Yahoo would be stopping its free version ofÂ WP-smushIt service and to continue using the plugin, I have to upgrade to pro version. This made me search for aÂ WP-smushItÂ alternative. After doing a bit of internet research, I ended up installing EWWW. Here&amp;rsquo;s my review for the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best keyword density checker for WordPress (2018)</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/best-keyword-density-checker-for-wordpress-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My technology blog was penalized at least 4 to 5 times. In my initial days of blogging career, I was not aware of terms like keyword density, on page SEO, backlinks, etc. I indulged myself in link building activities, and I was not focused on sharing top quality content. These three blogging mistakes killed my blog&amp;rsquo;s traffic up to 70 to 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they say, we learn from our mistakes and hard work pays off, I worked hard for 3 to 4 months to regain the lost traffic and rectified all errors that I committed. In those four months, I removed around 400 blog posts and improved the content quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Page load times of WordPress CMS powered blogs can decrease if webmasters start using a caching plugin. The two most widely used plugins for caching are W3TC and WordPress super cache. These 2 plugins create static HTML files from all of your blog posts and it saves these files to the cache folder on a disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress saves blog posts in database tables. When a search engine or a visitor requests it via permalink, WordPress loads the post from the database and it renders it as an HTML file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was a time when search engines like MSN, Bing, Yahoo, and Google were considered as the only source of website traffic. Now things have changed a lot. Social network sites like FB, Twitter, Google+ are used by billions of people across the world. When you have a good audience on sites like Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, Instagram, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to depend on search engines for website traffic. Blogs are probably incomplete without a social media plugin. These plugins make sharing of blog posts easier for visitors. Almost all websites (excluding social network sites) have such plugins installed on their website. Below are the three main advantages of these plugins:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve signed up for a limited hosting limited plan, then follow the below tricks/methods to reduce the bandwidth usage for your site. I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully implemented the below tricks in one of my site, and the bandwidth usage has reduced by 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reduce-image-size&#34;&gt;Reduce Image size&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using large images of a site can kill hosting bandwidth within a week unless you&amp;rsquo;re signed up for an unlimited hosting plan. If you&amp;rsquo;re using a content management system like WordPress, plugins like EWWW Image Optimizer or WP Smush it can take care of pictures you upload. If you&amp;rsquo;ve developed your site from scratch, then you should use Yahoo&amp;rsquo;s smushit online tool. The tool will reduce image size without affecting its quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
