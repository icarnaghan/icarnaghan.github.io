As you develop more complex code, you will come to rely on operators for performing the various functionally you are building. Before we dive into operators, let’s clear up a couple of fundamental programming terms, statements and expressions.
A statement is a line of code or action that consist of values, variables, and operators. In the last lesson you created several statements that assigned values to variables using the assignment = operator. Statements can set values but do not become values themselves. Statements end with a semi-colon. In contrast, an expression is a piece of code that resolves to a value, i.e. values, calculations resulting in other values, variables, and groups of variables.

To follow along, you will need a modern web browser, such as Google Chrome or equivalent with developer tools. You will also need a capable text editor. I highly recommend Microsoft Visual Studio Code. The first concept we are going to cover in this lesson is variables. Variables are spaces of memory where you can store information of a certain type, that can be retrieved later in your code.

As someone who has worked in the software development field for a number of years, I have witnessed accounts of poor decision making and its ramifications within the organizations I have worked for. Specifically within software development I have witnessed poor decision making during proposal efforts, architectural decisions, and delivery.
Bidding on work, especially within the federal space, can be a time consuming and involved effort by many parties. On technical proposals, it is essential that the correct mix of people are part of the proposal team. I have observed how biases within the expedience domain can often come to play within business development. One project I was recently involved with in the last few years suffered from lack of technical input during the proposal phase, and availability and confirmation bias led the team to under bid the work. This had negative consequences on expectation of scope and delivery efforts later on. The situation could have been prevented by ensuring more technical expertise was placed within the team and those making the decisions affecting scope did an objective evidence.

One of the benefits of working at a large organization is the opportunity to work with a considerable number of very bright and talented individuals. Recently I went through a role transition from traditionally supporting web based content management systems to supporting large interconnected systems. I was fortunate to connect with a colleague during that transition time who was well versed on the latest technologies and approaches in software development, specifically with a focus on distributed systems and modern systems integration. This post highlights five main areas that are worth research and understanding if modern-day systems integration projects is something you might be involved with in your current work or in the near future. My disclaimer is that I am not an expert in any of these domains, however I want to pass along good material that I will be studying further and is hopefully of benefit to others.

This infrastructure included an auto-scaling setup with load balancers hosting a ‘cache’ layer and an ‘application’ layer that hosted the Drupal CMS. On the backend tier, an AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) provided the MySQL database needed for the application. There were other components of the infrastructure such as our shared services for continuous integration, monitoring and development tools.

It turned out that there were three main issues that needed to be resolved. Two out of the three were relatively easy to find via the SSL Labs documentation, which required simple fixes to the ssl.conf file.
This server is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. If possible, disable SSL 3 to mitigate. This was relatively easy to fix. I resolved it by modifying ssl_protocols in the ssl.conf file - thank you Digital Ocean for your comprehensive write-up on this! The server does not support Forward Secrecy with the reference browsers. Again, more simple changes in the ssl.conf file. In case you run into a similar issue, be sure to read this helpful article, Configuring Apache, Nginx, and OpenSSL for Forward Secrecy. The third issue, however, was not quite as straightforward: This server accepts RC4 cipher, but only with older protocols. I found a number of helpful articles on this stating that by adding !RC4 to exclude RC4 in SSLCipherSuite, will result in mitigation of this vulnerability. I spent quite a bit of time trying different cypher list combinations and always including !RC4, however no matter how many times I tweak this, restart httpd and revisit SSL Labs, I kept getting the annoying ‘B’ grade and RC4 complaint. For anyone facing similar issues, I highly recommend reading Hardening Your Web Server’s SSL Ciphers.
