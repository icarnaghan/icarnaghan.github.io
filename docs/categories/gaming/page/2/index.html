A radically different way from what Koji Igarashi used us since it is neither more nor less than a 100 % fighting game.
Within two decades, the Konami gothic saga took the time to make a name with players in a sprawling building on a large number of different media. Today, the series extends primarily on consoles, waiting to know what will happen in the next major opus announced on PS3 and Xbox 360. As with SoulCalibur Legends, the Wii will finally be entitled to an episode of this prestigious marginal saga, the one this is the subject of this overview. Designed for the most unconditional fans, Castlevania Judgment certainly does not have the aura that characterizes the other parts of the series, but it is still a good opportunity to unwind alongside the cult figures of the saga

If their content is identical, the gaming experiences they provide vary widely, given the considerable changes made to gameplay by the Wii version, and it goes without saying that it necessarily benefits of an additional attraction in terms of discovery. Nevertheless it was legitimate to have some reservations and doubts about the effectiveness of its grip bold and unprecedented for a title of this magnitude. But to be among the first to have questioned the relevance of the outcome, let me dispel any fears you may have about this. Not only is the unique gameplay on the Wii version significantly renews the feeling of the game, but it is also intuitive enough to be forgotten in a few hours, the difficulties of taking control that inevitably occur when the familiar first time with a console of a new kind. Thus, cross swords through the Wiimote is going to become second nature, like each of the actions you’ll be asked to and you will see how fun that can be feel when engaged in a video game depends on the immersion.

But when we see how it has evolved in that time, we see that Nintendo has made the right choice by focusing on quality over quantity. Super Smash Bros. Brawl succeeds an episode GameCube already very convincing and dethrones without difficulty. Just start the software, the player is literally bombarded by an avalanche of game modes, new to most, and can only kneel before the proper amazing range of characters available.

A change that should delight all those for whom the name of Mario is totally separated from the platforms type, which at least has the merit of renewing a few things. It is hoped however that Nintendo has not drawn a line on the concept of the Mario RPG, but it is likely that the next title will be rather light on DS. Nevertheless, Super Paper Mario is not just a platform game, it is above all a constant source of amazement as it demonstrated creativity in both its playful design and design graph. The result is very refreshing and proves that the field of video game is full of hidden concepts waiting to finally be exploited.

The system evolution at the heart of this might he not have to change, or worse, distorting the very spirit of the series and the formula for Super Mario 64? Legitimate concerns, but in vain, since the idea to move Mario in a galaxy appears to be the key that opens the very doors of renewal and that allows him to leave behind him all his previous adventures.

So if Resident Evil 4 is still an excellent title on Wii, there is nothing new to his colleagues if not at the game console to own. Out of this, so it will still be entitled to the entire positive that this adjustment has the additions of the PS2 and PC versions starting with a game mode missing from the GameCube version: Separate Ways. The latter, like the assignment mode, you will lead the beautiful Ada throughout five missions. From the pure value added, especially the way that we proposed to visit a new decor and new looking kinematics. But before discussing this in detail, let us look at the original script.

Exhausted by years of wandering and fighting, he could push past his fight against the Dahaka and the curse of the sands of time, the Prince of Persia was an illusion to believe that he would finally know peace. But fate hounds brave men, and most recently, the tired hero takes up arms to face his worst enemy: himself. The scenario of evil Prince of Persia: Rival Swords is one of those who make you want to make a novel. All players who have overcome the hardships of the first two components together with the Prince know that we cannot forever endure such tortures without paying the price. Returned to Babylon with Kaileena, the Empress troubling time, the prince, nobody knows the name, discovers a city ravaged by war, a kingdom invaded by rivals more cruel than those which it has dealt so far. Therefore, the story starts quickly, leaving not even the soul time to break under the harsh fate that has befallen him. Victim of a conspiracy organized by a manipulative and tyrannical Vizier, Kaileena is killed in front of his eyes. Prince powerless to release the sands of time, even letting himself be contaminated by those who make the chew from the inside, corrupting his soul to bring out the evil that is in him and materialize in the form of sadistic entity: the Dark Prince. From a quality equivalent to the Two Kingdoms on GameCube, the achievement is as compelling and captivating. The opposition between the high and low quoted cities renews perfectly sets and the atmosphere that emanates from, and the animations are still among the very best at the moment.

Thus, paradoxical as it may seem, the doubt comes knocking at my door just as many blank pages await my impressions I sleep to tell you my journey, the same one that made me assume the role a Japanese divinity which has been a difficult task to restore color to a world fallen into a torpor monochromatic. The exercise is all the more difficult it is a kind of homage to a still-born point that deserved its deadly fate. But this is not the time for tears, if not joy, because constrained and forced, I am ready to really start this test and tell you about one of my best gaming events since I looked on my very first Game & Watch.

Because it ends the suspense, Guitar Hero 3 supplants its elders, admittedly few, but still. It must be said that the formula has not changed, not to say that it remains unchanged with the exception of a few discrete improvements and additions not necessarily essential. The first change in size provided by this third edition is obviously the partial abandonment of lumpish from the previous flap. Activision puts his hand to the portfolio as well to recall how the popularity of Guitar Hero actually an advertising and therefore unavoidable, we are left with almost half of the tracklist that consists of original songs, singer without risking a dangerous original interpreter imitation of the solo and without deviating a bit from our memories. The disadvantage is that by contrast, these times always seem to do most unfortunate that, inevitably. Composed, therefore, with security whose integrity has been little affected, the new playlist of the game is a pure marvel, perfectly balanced between musical styles and technical approaches. Rock, Alternative, Metal, Blues-Rock, the sounds of electric fan is not only spoiled by the variety of styles but also by the worthy representatives selected by and paid by Neversoft Activision.

Not happy enough with having conquered Hollywood, Spielberg is tackling now the gaming arena with the prestigious publisher Electronic Arts.
