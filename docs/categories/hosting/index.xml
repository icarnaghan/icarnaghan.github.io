      <title>What Makes AWS A Great Choice For Small Businesses?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though Amazon Web Services has been around for many years now, several persistent misconceptions abound, particularly among owners of small businesses. For instance, many of them believe AWS is for big players only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this perception arises from the fact that many online giants use AWS servers for hosting, including AOL, Reddit, and Netflix. Or perhaps the fact that AWS is the undisputed king of the cloud development world, with $17B sales in 2017 alone, has precipitated this misbelief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Godaddy is one of the top domain registrars and hosting companies of the world. It has over 500K customers.Â I&amp;rsquo;m one of the customers of Godaddy. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using its email hosting and domain registration service for 5 years. Here&amp;rsquo;s my review of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;list-of-godaddy-services-that-i-use&#34;&gt;List of GoDaddy services that I use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Premium email address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;domain-names&#34;&gt;Domain names&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>How to limit CPU usage on server effectively?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/how-to-limit-cpu-usage-on-server-effectively/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/how-to-limit-cpu-usage-on-server-effectively/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most hosting companies have introduced 2+ plans. The price of the hosting depends on the hardware and software the company is offering the customer. A plan that offers a low amount of RAM or a single core processor will be less expensive as compared to a plan that provides heaps of system memory and CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what plan you use, you must always keep an eye on the server CPU usage. If you don&amp;rsquo;t do so, a user process may use up to 90 - 100% CPU and other applications/system processes won&amp;rsquo;t be able to execute their tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Linode Review 2018: Great uptime and affordable plans</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/linode-review-2018-great-uptime-and-affordable-plans/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started my online career with a site hosted on Godaddy. I switched to A Small Orange from Godaddy after finding its plans cheap. After a major DNS incident, I quit ASO and bought shared hosting plan from Hostgator. HG shared plans are great for growing sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traffic to my site grew and I had launched a few more sites. To make sure that HG doesn&amp;rsquo;t ban my sites by high server resource usage, I bought unmanaged Hostgator VPS plan. The VPS had 512 MB RAM. Everything was going great. When I was holidaying at my native place, my sites were down for 8 hours. To find the reason for this, I logged into the server to go through PHP, Nginx, MySQL log, and system log files. The system log file had several &amp;ldquo;MYSQL server has gone away&amp;rdquo; entries. This problem occurs when the system doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough free memory for MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shared hosting plans are suitable for beginners and people with no knowledge of PHP, MySQL and Web servers. In a shared hosting, the company offers PhpMyAdmin, CPanel, Awstats (Google Analytics Alternative) and many more tools to make website configuration or deployment easier for a webmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared hosting comes with several limitations. Your site will be hosted with several other web portals, and it will have limited resource to use. Bandwidth usage will be a matter of concern. You are not allowed to experiment with PHP MySQL modules. Nor you can switch from Apache/Nginx to some other web server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many website hosting providers offer better features and more free add-ons but if budget is not a problem for you, choose a product on the basis of its quality, not quantity. Frankly speaking, the best hosting companies in the world are Hostgator and Bluehost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hostgator is a superb platform for hosting websites, but if your site has been banned for high resource utilization or some other reasons, you should consider signing up with Bluehost as it offers similar features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the 1st of April might have been the best day for you but it was an awful day for me. My top site, which generates a decent income was down for nearly 4 hours in the daytime. The site was not accessible to 100s of search engine users from 12:30 PM to 4:20 PM. TheÂ downtime was due to aÂ network issue and misconfiguration by ASO staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network issue started around 12:30 PM and it was resolved after 45 minutes. The staff moved the affected domains to a new IP address but the mapping was not correct. So from 1:00 PM onwards, the homepage of my blog was being redirected to some shi*t site. This resulted in 100s of 404 errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month, i decided to switch hosting from ******* to some other service. As there are many website hosting companies, i was confused to decide which one should I signup for. I was impressed with reviews on Hostgator, Inmotion, Bluehost and A2webhosting but I ended signing up for a small orange. ASO was suggested by some that folks have their blogs deployed on ASO servers. It has been a week since I moved my blog. I&amp;rsquo;m very satisfied with theÂ performance of my new host. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;my review of a small orange hosting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Internet was the result of some visionary people in the early 1960s who saw great potential value in allowing computers to share information on research and development in scientific and military fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howe, W (1998) A Brief History of the Internet&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www0.delphi.com/navnet/faq/history.html&#34;&gt;http://www0.delphi.com/navnet/faq/history.html&lt;/a&gt; (January 28th, 2000)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;history-of-the-internet&#34;&gt;History of the Internet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet has had a relatively brief but also explosive history over the last few decades. It originated from an experiment, started by the U.S. Department of Defence during the 1960s. The Department of Defence wanted to create a computer network that would continue to function in the event of a disaster, such as a nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evolution of ISPs Introduction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Internet has grown beyond a simple tool for a small number of education and government agencies over the last few years. The commercialization of the Internet has opened a brand new market for small, medium and large commercial bodies to provide access to this huge network of opportunity for business and home users alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These companies are the sole providers of access to the âInformation Super-Highwayâ and it is therefore important to analyse how they have managed to survive in the past as well as their current and future success. The basis of this dissertation has concentrated mainly on the small to medium sized ISP providing services to the local business community and tends to concentrate on the issues involved here. It is important to look into periods of the past few years and how ISPs have developed into the providers that are common on the market place today. Through analysing the changes that ISPs have faced in the past, this will give a better gauge as to where the ISP needs to look to for future opportunities and more importantly, future survival.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ISPs Currently in Todayâs Changing Market</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned within the last chapter, Internet Service Providers have been forced and are currently being driven away from the traditional subscription access only service. Nowadays, many ISPs have started to offer free access to the Internet in order to drive customers to their services. The first of this kind of service within the United Kingdom was Freeserve. They originally had the backing of the Currys group to market their free Tier 3 ISP to the general public, which proved to be extremely successful. After the launch of Freeserve, many other Internet Service Providers began to offer free access through a dial-up service in order to compete within the market.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ITS Internet Case Study</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been surprising to see the amount of small Internet based companies that have âmade it bigâ within a very short period of time. Perhaps it has been the pure innovation of releasing a particular service on-line or offering goods that no one else had yet thought of. Perhaps it has just been a case of the company getting in before others had giving them the edge that would continue for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Security Issues to be Addressed by ISPs</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet has become a vast marketplace for global goods and services. For e-commerce to prosper, you have to feel safe about transmitting credit card and other financial information over the Internet. Because information traveling over the network actually passes through many computers along the way, the opportunity exists for someone to steal confidential information. Hackers also break into computers to steal data. No one really knows how often this actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Future of ISPs</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Service Providers (ISP) frequently have to face the question as to how they can protect their existing business and, at the same time, remain profitable in the future. For, on the one hand, the strong concentration process drastically shrinks the margins of pure access providing. New competitors, for example the major telecommunications companies, are flooding the market with ever cheaper offers. Prices continue to fall. And customers, who are becoming more and more &amp;ldquo;literate&amp;rdquo;, are now designing their own HTML pages. To quote a study issued by the European Union (EG DGXIII.A3) ISPs will not survive in the long term if they do not provide add-on services such as consulting or electronic publishing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
