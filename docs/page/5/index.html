This article details the analysis of a dataset called Laptop Prices, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset comprises 1300 records of various laptop models, which was last updated six months ago from writing, adding additional laptop characteristics and prices. This analysis will begin with Watson Analytics starting points, which is helpful for exploration purposes. Watson provides pre-defined suggestions that help the user determine the best way to proceed with their own analysis. These starting points provide insight on the different facets of data available within the dataset. The Laptop Prices data consists of the following data:

As you develop more complex code, you will come to rely on operators for performing the various functionally you are building. Before we dive into operators, let’s clear up a couple of fundamental programming terms, statements and expressions.
A statement is a line of code or action that consist of values, variables, and operators. In the last lesson you created several statements that assigned values to variables using the assignment = operator. Statements can set values but do not become values themselves. Statements end with a semi-colon. In contrast, an expression is a piece of code that resolves to a value, i.e. values, calculations resulting in other values, variables, and groups of variables.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript provides the interactive functionality commonly used throughout the web. In this lesson you will be introduced to some of the core concepts of JavaScript.
To follow along, you will need a modern web browser, such as Google Chrome or equivalent with developer tools. You will also need a capable text editor. I highly recommend Microsoft Visual Studio Code. The first concept we are going to cover in this lesson is variables. Variables are spaces of memory where you can store information of a certain type, that can be retrieved later in your code.

We have access to a wealth of information that, if used properly, can help drive decisions and bring about success within organizations. Why then are so many top-level executive decisions driven by intuition and gut feel?
There have been countless examples over the last decade of commercial failures that could have been avoided if a greater analytical approach had been adopted and used in evidence based thinking and decision making. Unfortunately adopting and integrating analytics into the operational and strategic decisions has it’s challenges. Two of the largest hurdles to successful integration of evidence-based decision making fall within the organizational culture and awareness or education.

The goals of this initiative is to facilitate large-scale practice transformation through several support structures, Practice Transformation Networks (PTN), Support and Alignment Networks (SANS), and SANS 2. PTNs are peer-based learning networks with the aim of coaching, mentoring to support clinicians in practice transformation. SANs provide workforce development using existing education, competency and certification tools and support the recruitment of clinician practices in underserved communities. SANs 2 are a catalyst for the adoption of alternative payment models aimed at the new quality payment program.

I’ve witnessed the positive and negative effects of organizational culture both in regards to the individual as well as decision making, that has a profound effect on others. In the article Decision-Making: The Impact of Organizational Culture, (Buchanan, 2018) cites the positives of a small organizational structure with a culture of collaboration (everyone wearing multiple hats and helping each other out). At the same time she warns about misalignment between culture and behaviors and how evidence and data driven decision making, when used incorrectly, can have adverse results.

As someone who has worked in the software development field for a number of years, I have witnessed accounts of poor decision making and its ramifications within the organizations I have worked for. Specifically within software development I have witnessed poor decision making during proposal efforts, architectural decisions, and delivery.
Bidding on work, especially within the federal space, can be a time consuming and involved effort by many parties. On technical proposals, it is essential that the correct mix of people are part of the proposal team. I have observed how biases within the expedience domain can often come to play within business development. One project I was recently involved with in the last few years suffered from lack of technical input during the proposal phase, and availability and confirmation bias led the team to under bid the work. This had negative consequences on expectation of scope and delivery efforts later on. The situation could have been prevented by ensuring more technical expertise was placed within the team and those making the decisions affecting scope did an objective evidence.
