Howe, W (1998) A Brief History of the Internet
http://www0.delphi.com/navnet/faq/history.html (January 28th, 2000)
History of the Internet The Internet has had a relatively brief but also explosive history over the last few decades. It originated from an experiment, started by the U.S. Department of Defence during the 1960s. The Department of Defence wanted to create a computer network that would continue to function in the event of a disaster, such as a nuclear war.

Nowadays, many ISPs have started to offer free access to the Internet in order to drive customers to their services. The first of this kind of service within the United Kingdom was Freeserve. They originally had the backing of the Currys group to market their free Tier 3 ISP to the general public, which proved to be extremely successful. After the launch of Freeserve, many other Internet Service Providers began to offer free access through a dial-up service in order to compete within the market.

Perhaps it has been the pure innovation of releasing a particular service on-line or offering goods that no one else had yet thought of. Perhaps it has just been a case of the company getting in before others had giving them the edge that would continue for many years to come.

For e-commerce to prosper, you have to feel safe about transmitting credit card and other financial information over the Internet. Because information traveling over the network actually passes through many computers along the way, the opportunity exists for someone to steal confidential information. Hackers also break into computers to steal data. No one really knows how often this actually happens.

For, on the one hand, the strong concentration process drastically shrinks the margins of pure access providing. New competitors, for example the major telecommunications companies, are flooding the market with ever cheaper offers. Prices continue to fall. And customers, who are becoming more and more “literate”, are now designing their own HTML pages. To quote a study issued by the European Union (EG DGXIII.A3) ISPs will not survive in the long term if they do not provide add-on services such as consulting or electronic publishing.

When looking at how this type of communication is possible, it is necessary to examine the physical hardware and software processes involved. A multi-drop link is quite simply a very basic communication device that enables multiple Personal Computers to interconnect with each other. This is made possible through a special chip found inside all Intel x86 PC’s called the Universal Synchronous / Asynchronous Receiver / Transmitter (USART). This chip allows two important processes that are required for any type of two-way communications. Input and Output of data can be sent to and from this chip which therefore makes it possible to build a link to another of it’s kind.
