      <title>TypeScript Demystified</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TypeScript can be a confusing term for anyone new to JavaScript development. The first impression of TypeScript for beginners is that it is a programming language, more or less, similar to JavaScript. Even professionals with enough coding experience often fail to define TypeScript. So how can we put the answer to this question - What is TypeScript?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It has optional static typing, classes, and interfaces. TypeScript is not a separate programming language, what makes it different from JavaScript lies in part of its name - &lt;em&gt;Type&lt;/em&gt;. Every programming language has data types, In JavaScript these include the commonly used number, string, boolean, etc. To understand TypeScript, we first need to understand how JavaScript behaves with its data types.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Entity Modeling in OpenText AppWorks</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/getting-started-with-entity-modeling-in-opentext-appworks/</link>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/getting-started-with-entity-modeling-in-opentext-appworks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;AppWorks provides a handy feature for modeling business objects through the use of entities. Objects could take the form of any aspect of a business application you are building. For example, if you needed to write an application that would be used as part of a school&amp;rsquo;s administration system you may include entities that represented objects such as teachers, students, courses, lessons, and so on. AppWorks provides a nice interface for managing these different types of entities and even lets you build relationships. The term entity modeling is not new to this platform, the concept behind this has been around for a long time, but it has traditionally been the responsibility of database engineers or software developers to define. The low-code platform AppWorks provides now enables business analysts to define these entities and relationships, without the need to have a software engineering background.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an ever more global and connected world, knowing a foreign language is becoming a more valuable and necessary skill. Fortunately, the modern age has added a new dimension to language learning and today’s learner has more tools at his disposal than ever before, all thanks to the Internet. But at the end of the day, it’s still the same old problem that you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink. Learning a language still takes persistence and the willingness to learn, and unfortunately there is no tool yet invented to combat that, and I don’t think there ever will be, but the problem in successful language learning may lie in us purposefully choosing the most difficult path.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Low-Code Development with OpenText AppWorks</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/low-code-development-with-opentext-appworks/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/low-code-development-with-opentext-appworks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenText AppWorks is an application development platform that enables rapid creation of software designed to meet business problems. It&amp;rsquo;s low-code capabilities means that we can involve requirements specialists and business analysts in the development process while working along-side developers implementing more advanced services integrations and business processes. A few months ago I wrote a couple of articles outlining how to install AppWorks locally using Docker as well as setting up a version control system for your applications using SVN. If you are interested in setting up AppWorks as a development environment, I highly recommend checking these out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understanding Asynchronous JavaScript</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/understanding-asynchronous-javascript/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;asynchronous&amp;rdquo; is often associated with JavaScript, which can be a confusing concept, especially for beginners. This can become even more confusing because JavaScript is a synchronous language with asynchronous capabilities. In order to understand asynchronous development in general, we need to start with the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming. In simple terms, executing one task or item at a time is often referred to as synchronous, while executing multiple tasks (or threads) at a time is referred to as asynchronous.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understanding Higher Order Functions in JavaScript</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/understanding-higher-order-functions-in-javascript/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/understanding-higher-order-functions-in-javascript/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A function is an organized block of code that is created for a specific task. It can accept and return values. The main purpose of using functions is for code reusability and organization. In JavaScript, functions can be considered &amp;lsquo;higher-order&amp;rsquo;. To better understand this term, we need to look at some basic concepts related to JavaScript functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;functions-in-javascript&#34;&gt;Functions in JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the following code snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;demo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;This is a demo function&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;demo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very basic example of a JavaScript function. The name of the function is &amp;ldquo;demo&amp;rdquo; and its prints &amp;ldquo;This is a demo function!&amp;rdquo; in the console. We we can do a lot more with this function, including assigning it to a variable, or passing it to another function as a parameter. This is possible because JavaScript is a functional programming language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have ever come across Node.js, then you may have heard the word &amp;ldquo;Express.js&amp;rdquo;. Express is also a part of popular full-stack web development stacks - MEAN and MERN. M, A/R, and N, meaning MongoDB, Angular/React, and Node.js, respectively are very popular in the web development community, while E, i.e. Express.js is unpopular. Many developers who work with MEAN or MERN stack don&amp;rsquo;t even know what is the exact meaning of express. So in this article, we will discuss express.js with examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;Node.js&amp;rdquo; is very popular today in the web development community. Everyone is talking about Node.js. The IT giants, startups, everyone wants Node.js developers. But what is Node.js and why it is so popular? Simply put, Node.js is nothing but JavaScript outside the browser. Yes, you read it right. Node.js is JavaScript that runs outside the browser. Not much difference, right? But no doubt, Node.js is one of the most popular &amp;ldquo;language&amp;rdquo; today. So in this article, we will discuss everything about Node.js. Before we jump to node.js, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about JavaScript first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understanding the Role of Kubernetes in Application Development</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/understanding-the-role-of-kubernetes-in-application-development/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/understanding-the-role-of-kubernetes-in-application-development/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional software application development depended upon a mirroring of all conditions across launch environments including the supporting hardware structure and configuration, the operating system, and the asset files. Even slight variations between the development environment and the launch environment can result in application error or failure. This model of software development and launch created needless complexity, taxing limited server resources. The development and implementation of Kubernetes has eliminated most of these issues, smoothing out the path from development and testing to launch and implementation. Understanding the role of Kubernetes in your application development is essential if you are to avoid many of these application development and launch issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating a Super Simple JavaScript Validated Form</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/creating-a-super-simple-javascript-validated-form/</link>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/creating-a-super-simple-javascript-validated-form/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are times when you need to create a basic HTML form that provides validation to end users. Without leveraging a framework or additional libraries, this can be easily achieved by using JavaScript directly. This article walks through the basic steps of creating a simple validated form using basic selectors and error handling. Our requirements are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For successful submission, all fields must be entered correctly within our validation rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If one or more error occurs, the form will not submit. Feedback provided to the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A correct form with no errors once submitted, will send an email to the recipient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real life we would most likely have a call to a web service or some other piece of code that would execute once a form was submitted with no errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting up a Local SVN Container for your AppWorks Development Environment</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/setting-up-a-local-svn-container-for-your-appworks-development-environment/</link>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/setting-up-a-local-svn-container-for-your-appworks-development-environment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post I walked through the process of setting up a local instance of AppWorks 20.2 using the container image from OpenText. Any development work ideally should be managed in Version Control System (VCS). The preferred VCS for OpenText AppWorks is Subversion (SVN). It has been a long time since I used SVN so I needed to quickly bring myself up to speed. Thankfully there is a handy quick start guide at Apache that walks through the various SVN commands. Once you have SVN installed, the &amp;lsquo;svn help&amp;rsquo; command also provides a nice breakdown of everything you would need to know to successfully navigate an SVN repository. Since I&amp;rsquo;m already using Docker for my AppWorks installation, it makes sense that I would also want to use this platform to run my SVN server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Language Learning Journey</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always had an interest in learning Spanish. Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled with various language learning programs, however I never really stuck at them for long.  I have probably spent more time researching language learning programs and techniques, than I have actually practiced the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States Foreign Service Institute, or FSI, estimates that the Spanish language takes approximately 750 hours of study to build fluency. Unfortunately, FSI classes are reserved for Diplomats and involve dedicating 30 weeks of full-time study to reach the desired hours needed for mastery.  My approach has involved a longer-term strategy involving daily practice and drills using multiple modes of learning, vocabulary building using spaced repetition, and immersion techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past September (2019) I decided I would make a commitment to making language learning a daily part of my life. As it so happened, my job also changed around this time, increasing my commute time and therefore bringing a new opportunity to use this time wisely. Since then, I have completed all five levels of Pimsleur Spanish and coupled my study with several other programs. My approach seems to be working at lease for me currently and my goal is to reach B1 proficiency by September 2020. This write up is to share my some of the success I&amp;rsquo;ve had with various language learning resources and communities that have informed and guided my studies. These are just my own opinions and experiences, I in no way claim to be an expert on language learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In programming, there are many ways to work with strings. A performant way to work with them is through the use of Regular expressions, also known as Regex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using regular expressions, you can search for a substring within a string, replace a substring within a string, and extract information from that string. Regular expressions are supported in almost every language. There can be small differences, but the general concept is the same. Javascript is one of the few languages that has direct built-in support for regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Important Features of ES6</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/important-features-of-es6/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;EcmaScript is the standardized scripting language that JavaScript and some other languages, like ActionScript implement. JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 and became an ECMA standard in 1997. ECMAScript 2015 is version 6 of the ECMA Script programming language therefore known as ES6. There are many new features in ES6 which are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;block-scoping&#34;&gt;Block Scoping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of block scoping created confusion in ES5. A new keyword &lt;strong&gt;let&lt;/strong&gt; works similarly to var but the variable it declares is block-scoped and exists within the current block only.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JavaScript Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM)</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/javascript-manipulating-the-document-object-model-dom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The way in which logical structure of a document is accessed and manipulated in HTML is known as Document Object Model or DOM. It is a programming interface for HTML. Whenever a document loads in the browser, a tree-like (or forest) structure is created. Methods provided by the DOM can be used to access and manipulate this tree programmatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-use-dom&#34;&gt;Why use DOM?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOM is used to access and manipulate elements in an HTML document. But why do we need to use the DOM for this? Let&amp;rsquo;s understand this by use of an example. Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose we have an input field and a button next to it. When the button is clicked, whatever typed in the input field should appear below the input field. How can we do this with plain HTML? We need to dynamically access the value of the input field on the button click and then display the value below in a paragraph. We will implement this example, but first, we should discuss DOM methods that will be needed for accessing and manipulating elements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been doing any development in Angular, the chances are you have been using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for your editor. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t been using Visual Studio Code, I highly recommend checking it out. There are a number of extensions that I have come to rely on that greatly simplify my development workflow listed below. I&amp;rsquo;ve included my favorite top ten with their descriptions and links below. To install them, simply start VS Code and open the command palette (Ctrl-Shift-P) Windows / Linux or (Cmd-Shift-P) Mac, and select Install Extension. Choose the extension name from the list and once installed reload/restart Visual Studio Code. Hopefully you will find these extensions as useful I do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last couple of lessons focused on arrays, and hopefully by now you will have come to see the value of using them in your code. Objects expand on the concept of arrays, except for a few differences, which provide greater control of the data stored. It is said, in Javascript, &amp;ldquo;Almost everything is objects&amp;rdquo;. Dates are always objects, Arrays are always objects, functions are always objects, and regular expressions are always objects. Primitive data types such as Numbers, Boolean and Strings are also objects when defined with the new keyword.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/7-ways-to-improve-your-sites-crawlability-and-why-you-should/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While keyword research, link-building, content optimization, and other on-page strategies can improve your domain&amp;rsquo;s search ranking, search engine optimization (SEO) starts with getting your pages indexed and to do that you need to ensure they&amp;rsquo;re crawler-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crawler bots, like human users, appreciate sites which have clear, structured, readable data. However, since crawlers can only spend a limited amount of time and resources per site, domains with incoherent site maps, broken links, or 404 errors might not get indexed at all, effectively invisibilizing it for all potential users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/object-oriented-programming-demystified/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Object-oriented programming (OOP) is the most common programming type and an essential part of popular programming languages, such as Java, C++ and C#. Its name offers an insight into how OOP languages work, which is by revolving around objects and using objects to get things done. The term object refers to a chunk of code that acts together as a whole and can be reused at any time, as well as interact with other objects. Some of the very basic elements of OOP include objects, classes and methods. Object-oriented programming works in a way that enables programmers to reuse their code and use it in multiple different instances, without having to write the code all over again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JavaScript Arrow Functions: How Do They Work?</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/javascript-arrow-functions-how-do-they-work/</link>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/javascript-arrow-functions-how-do-they-work/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ES6 introduced a number of exciting features to the JavaScript standard classes, string templates, array and object de-structuring, block-scope variable declarations with &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;const&amp;rdquo;, and perhaps the most visible new feature, arrow functions. Arrow functions have quickly become the standard way of writing functions among professional JavaScript developers. Because they are so widespread, it&amp;rsquo;s essential for every JavaScript programmer to understand arrow functions - what they are, how to write them, and how they are different from ordinary functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has worked in JavaScript for any amount of time will likely come across concepts that require a deeper level of study in order to fully understand. Closures is certainly one of those areas that has caused me to review and experiment with several times. The purpose of this article is to provide a succinct overview of closures and offer several snippets of code to play around with in order to better understand this often tricky to grasp concept. Consciously or Unconsciously, most developers use closures while programming in JavaScript. Most of the time, everything works fine, but it is always better to understand how they work as they provide better control over your code. Moreover, at some point you might be asked to explain what closures are and hopefully by the end of this you will be in a much better position to do that. So let&amp;rsquo;s start with what a closure is. A simplified explanation would be that a closure is an inner function that has access to the variables of the outer function. This is called the scope chain. See my earlier article on JavaScript Scope if you need a refresher.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Asset Security is the second domain of the CISSP. This domain focuses heavily on classification of data and labels used, various roles within an organization, data security controls and frameworks, baselining and hardening, and the various states of data. In addition to this data remanence and destruction are also covered and should be understood for the exam, especially understanding the difference between traditional magnetic storage vs newer solid state devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every User Experience Researcher in the world gets the request of performing a &lt;strong&gt;Heuristic Evaluation&lt;/strong&gt; at least once in their lifetime. But it is not always clear if the requester knows precisely about this process of evaluation. What happens is, they hear a word in trend, and they request it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before you dive right into the heuristics evaluation of the website, you need to be aware of what it is and how you can conduct it with precision. Take some time and learn about all the ins and outs of the technique.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Security Risk Management is the first domain of the CISSP. These are some notes highlighting areas of study for this domain and are by no means a comprehensive set of materials for preparing for this certification. The content below is what I have used to better prepare for this domain. Before reviewing this section, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already taken Kelly Handerhan&amp;rsquo;s CISSP course, I would highly recommend spending some time going through it. It is by far the most engaging and relevant video series I&amp;rsquo;ve seen for CISSP study prep. In the first domain she covers a slide called the tenants of secure design, which is also very relevant here. At a minimum, make sure you are familiar with concepts she covers here including risk analysis, defense in depth, fail safe, KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid), completeness of design, open design, redundancy, separation of duties, mandatory vacations, job rotation, and others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re 40 years old or older, you might have learned how to use a computer on an old Commodore 64, Apple II or another computer about the same age. One of the things you probably learned about was the BASIC programming language. Maybe you were lucky enough to have a computer at home. One thing you probably learned was that if you wanted to play games, one way was to buy computer magazines at the bookstore and type in published source code. If you&amp;rsquo;re like some people, you learned a few things about programming from typing in those games, and went on to write your own. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/modern-design-approaches-frameworks-and-resources/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, several web design trends have exploded in popularity and different frameworks and libraries have emerged to support them. It&amp;rsquo;s been close to a decade since the term &amp;lsquo;responsive&amp;rsquo; became mainstream and changed our way of thinking about the structure of our applications across devices. Since that time other design philosophies have followed as we sought ways to improve the user experience across a diverse range of platforms. At the same time tools and techniques have continued to improve to arm designers with the right frameworks, libraries and approaches to deliver the best user experiences possible. In this article I will cover some of the more popular design approaches and libraries that can be used to implement them. I&amp;rsquo;ll conclude with a quick list of several wireframing tools that can also be used in design. I recommend checking out each of these resources via the links provided below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/relational-vs-star-schema-model/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two main philosophies that have become prominent over the past several decades with information management pioneered by Bill Inmon and Ralph Kimball. Nagesh &amp;amp; Cody (2005) provide an overview of these contrasting approaches, which are vastly different with their own merits and downsides. Inmon believes in building a large centralized enterprise-wide data warehouse using a relational database. Kimball on the other hand recommends starting by defining data marts (subsets of data around a specific domain, or use case) within a star schema. In order to understand these approaches, it is essential to understand the main differences between a relational model and a star model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JavaScript Arrays - Properties and Methods</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are going to cover some of the most commonly used properties and methods in JavaScript, for working with arrays. There are a lot of other methods which are not covered here, including newer ES6 methods. The goal here is to get you started working with arrays and gaining an understanding of the fundamental ways we can access and manipulate data. The table below summarizes the various methods we will cover in this lesson:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JavaScript Arrays - Fundamentals</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/javascript-arrays-fundamentals/</link>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/javascript-arrays-fundamentals/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier we looked at datatypes and variables. Arrays take the concept of a variable or binding one step further and allow us to form groups of values within a data structure, which we can then manage in our code. A good use for an array is a list of data. Arrays not only let you group data, but they offer a range of tools or methods to update and manipulate their contents. They are used commonly across different programming languages and have become a routine way of passing around data within applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JavaScript Scope</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/javascript-scope/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scope determines what variables or bindings are available to JavaScript within its current context. For example, if a variable is defined outside of any functions within your code (often referred to as the main call stack), these variables are available to all other code embedded within other blocks and functions. Variables defined in main are often referred to as &amp;lsquo;Global Variables&amp;rsquo; because they are globally available throughout your application. But what about those variables that are defined within functions?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In earlier lessons, we wrote code without using any functions. Now that you have been introduced to the various ways we can organize our code within function declarations and expressions, it is helpful to step back for a moment to understand the flow of execution within our code. JavaScript uses a call stack to in order to manage this flow, which is essentially a data structure (or to-do list) that keeps track of function calls using a Last In First Out (LIFO) ordering system. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at an example to help explain this concept.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Functions are repeatable blocks of code. They are fundamental to most programming languages and allow you to build applications with reusable code that can be called with different arguments. The best way to explain functions is through an example. Suppose you wanted a quick way to calculate how much your bill would be with tip (assume for this example the bill amount includes tax).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;try-it-out&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;→ Try it out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create two files called &lt;strong&gt;index.html&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;script.js&lt;/strong&gt; and enter the code below into each. Alternatively, if you followed along in the previous lesson, use the existing script.js file and replace its content with code below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JavaScript Loops</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/javascript-loops/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Often in programming, we need to carry out similar instructions a number of different times. Loops help reduce redundant code and let you quickly offload repetitive tasks to the computer. In JavaScript there are several types of loops. In this lesson we are going to examine while, do while, and for loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;while-and-do-while-loops&#34;&gt;While and Do While loops&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As their names suggest, while and do while loops carry out a number of tasks &amp;lsquo;while&amp;rsquo; a certain condition is true. Take for example the need to display a series of  numbers each incrementing by 1 until it we reach a certain limit (10). This could be carried out by writing the following code:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Makes AWS A Great Choice For Small Businesses?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though Amazon Web Services has been around for many years now, several persistent misconceptions abound, particularly among owners of small businesses. For instance, many of them believe AWS is for big players only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this perception arises from the fact that many online giants use AWS servers for hosting, including AOL, Reddit, and Netflix. Or perhaps the fact that AWS is the undisputed king of the cloud development world, with $17B sales in 2017 alone, has precipitated this misbelief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watson Analytics provides a powerful suite of display and rapid reporting options. This article looks at two distinct datasets from Kaggle, Laptop Price and Mobile Price Classification. By using the display options available within Watson Analytics, the ability to create a compelling story possible. Both sets of analysis are focused around the target variable of price (or price_range), and the details of these datasets have been included below for reference. Laptop Price consists of records of various laptop models, that were last updated six months ago from writing, adding additional laptop characteristics and prices. Mobile Price Classification provides data on mobile phones including price range classifications.  Analysis of data quality and cleansing will not be discussed in this article. Rather the focus of building compelling visualizations and telling a story are the priority here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I wrote an article called Using jQuery.AJAX() to Retrieve Sample JSON Data. Since this time I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly using more and more native JavaScript to get things done, so I thought it was time to revisit this concept using the fetch() API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been very convenient over the years to use jQuery to simplify tasks that otherwise would have been more challenging to write in native JavaScript. Since ES6 has become pretty much mainstream nowadays, it is safe to take advantage of some of the features and benefits it brings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conditional statements (commonly called if statements) provide a way for JavaScript to make decisions and run specified code based on a set of criteria. In JavaScript, the criteria or condition is surrounded in parenthesis and the resulting code to run is contained in a block. Up until now, we have been examining single line statements. In JavaScript, a block of code is surrounded by curly braces. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at an example.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watson Analytics provides a suite of analytics tools that are easy to use for non-technical people. The software opens the door for data preparation and exploration for managers and other personnel who would benefit from analysis but don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have the advanced analytical background. This article details the analysis of a dataset called Laptop Prices, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset comprises 1300 records of various laptop models, which was last updated six months ago from writing, adding additional laptop characteristics and prices. This analysis will begin with Watson Analytics starting points, which is helpful for exploration purposes. Watson provides pre-defined suggestions that help the user determine the best way to proceed with their own analysis. These starting points provide insight on the different facets of data available within the dataset. The Laptop Prices data consists of the following data:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JavaScript Operators</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/javascript-operators/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;JavaScript provides different kinds of operators which enable us to perform actions on given values or variables used in our code. As you develop more complex code, you will come to rely on operators for performing the various functionally you are building. Before we dive into operators, let&amp;rsquo;s clear up a couple of fundamental programming terms, statements and expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A statement is a line of code or action that consist of values, variables, and operators. In the last lesson you created several statements that assigned values to variables using the assignment = operator. &lt;strong&gt;Statements can set values but do not become values themselves&lt;/strong&gt;. Statements end with a semi-colon. In contrast, an expression is a piece of code that resolves to a value, i.e. values, calculations resulting in other values, variables, and groups of variables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is one of the three core technologies used to build websites and web applications. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript provides the interactive functionality commonly used throughout the web. In this lesson you will be introduced to some of the core concepts of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow along, you will need a modern web browser, such as Google Chrome or equivalent with developer tools. You will also need a capable text editor. I highly recommend Microsoft Visual Studio Code. The first concept we are going to cover in this lesson is variables. Variables are spaces of memory where you can store information of a certain type, that can be retrieved later in your code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Your Organization Using Evidence-Based Decision Making?</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/is-your-organization-using-evidence-based-decision-making/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are more ways to access data through a large amount of software tools than there has ever been in the history of analytics. We have access to a wealth of information that, if used properly, can help drive decisions and bring about success within organizations. Why then are so many top-level executive decisions driven by intuition and gut feel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been countless examples over the last decade of commercial failures that could have been avoided if a greater analytical approach had been adopted and used in evidence based thinking and decision making. Unfortunately adopting and integrating analytics into the operational and strategic decisions has it&amp;rsquo;s challenges. Two of the largest hurdles to successful integration of evidence-based decision making fall within the organizational culture and awareness or education.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has launched several programs over the years with the goal of improving healthcare in the United States. The Transforming Clinical Practices Initiative (TCPI) is one of these programs, that was built to support clinician practices through peer-based learning. The goals of this initiative is to facilitate large-scale practice transformation through several support structures, Practice Transformation Networks (PTN),  Support and Alignment Networks (SANS), and SANS 2. PTNs are peer-based learning networks with the aim of coaching, mentoring to support clinicians in practice transformation. SANs provide workforce development using existing education, competency and certification tools and support the recruitment of clinician practices in underserved communities. SANs 2 are a catalyst for the adoption of alternative payment models aimed at the new quality payment program.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Organizational culture has an impact on how a business functions. (O’Reilly III, Chatman, &amp;amp; Caldwell, 1991) echo the agreement of researchers over the years that culture may be an important factor in determining how well an individual fits an organizational context. I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed the positive and negative effects of organizational culture both in regards to the individual as well as decision making, that has a profound effect on others. In the article Decision-Making: The Impact of Organizational Culture, (Buchanan, 2018) cites the positives of a small organizational structure with a culture of collaboration (everyone wearing multiple hats and helping each other out). At the same time she warns about misalignment between culture and behaviors and how evidence and data driven decision making, when used incorrectly, can have adverse results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Poor Decisions Impacted by Bias in Software Development</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/poor-decisions-impacted-by-bias-in-software-development/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beyond Bias provides an excellent overview of the five different categories of biases, similarity, expedience, experience, distance, and safety. As someone who has worked in the software development field for a number of years, I have witnessed accounts of poor decision making and its ramifications within the organizations I have worked for. Specifically within software development I have witnessed poor decision making during proposal efforts, architectural decisions, and delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bidding on work, especially within the federal space, can be a time consuming and involved effort by many parties. On technical proposals, it is essential that the correct mix of people are part of the proposal team. I have observed how biases within the expedience domain can often come to play within business development. One project I was recently involved with in the last few years suffered from lack of technical input during the proposal phase, and availability and confirmation bias led the team to under bid the work. This had negative consequences on expectation of scope and delivery efforts later on. The situation could have been prevented by ensuring more technical expertise was placed within the team and those making the decisions affecting scope did an objective evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of working at a large organization is the opportunity to work with a considerable number of very bright and talented individuals. Recently I went through a role transition from traditionally supporting web based content management systems to supporting large interconnected systems. I was fortunate to connect with a colleague during that transition time who was well versed on the latest technologies and approaches in software development, specifically with a focus on distributed systems and modern systems integration. This post highlights five main areas that are worth research and understanding if modern-day systems integration projects is something you might be involved with in your current work or in the near future. My disclaimer is that I am not an expert in any of these domains, however I want to pass along good material that I will be studying further and is hopefully of benefit to others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Top 8 Best Business Listing Sites (2018)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The number of internet users has grown from 100 to 3+ billion. Although a lot of firms have benefited from the internet revolution, many businesses have become bankrupt. eCommerce platforms have destroyed the business of 1000s of brick and mortar stores. The only way to survive the wrath of these sites is to make people aware of your shop/service and the products you sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listing a business online is the best way to promote it. Although there are 100s of sites where you can list your office, shop, or service, not all sites are trustworthy or complete. Businesses won&amp;rsquo;t benefit from such sites. Hence, they should not be listed on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best IDE for PHP Web Development</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PHP is a scripting language that powers over some of the busiest websites on the web. Several languages have been introduced since 2005. None of them have affected the popularity of PHP. Before IDEs were launched, seasoned developers and beginners used vi or notepad to write PHP code. Once the code was ready, developers moved the PHP file to the webapps folder of the web server to check whether their code is working as expected or not. If the browser didn&amp;rsquo;t display error, developers used to check log files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlike search engines that rank pages on the basis of various factors, Social networking portals display posts in groups and on pages in first-in-last-out order. If the page is old, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to scroll down the group until you find it. If the title of the post is interesting, people will share the post on their profiles or in groups they&amp;rsquo;ve joined. Such pages are called viral posts. They have the potential of bringing a large amount of traffic to a website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to limit CPU usage on server effectively?</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/how-to-limit-cpu-usage-on-server-effectively/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most hosting companies have introduced 2+ plans. The price of the hosting depends on the hardware and software the company is offering the customer. A plan that offers a low amount of RAM or a single core processor will be less expensive as compared to a plan that provides heaps of system memory and CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what plan you use, you must always keep an eye on the server CPU usage. If you don&amp;rsquo;t do so, a user process may use up to 90 - 100% CPU and other applications/system processes won&amp;rsquo;t be able to execute their tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A project I was recently working on had in place a cloud-based infrastructure that was designed to support a single installation of the Drupal CMS running in Amazon Web Services (AWS). This infrastructure included an auto-scaling setup with load balancers hosting a &amp;lsquo;cache&amp;rsquo; layer and an &amp;lsquo;application&amp;rsquo; layer that hosted the Drupal CMS. On the backend tier, an AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) provided the MySQL database needed for the application. There were other components of the infrastructure such as our shared services for continuous integration, monitoring and development tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the United States, a sizable amount of the overall federal budget is allocated to defense spending. The 2018 Defense Budget was signed into law on December 12, 2017, by President Trump, which authorized just under $700 billion in defense spending (Blankenstein, 2017). In contrast to just a few years ago where the fiscal year defense spending was set at $593 billion, the amount of money set aside for defense continues to grow. Traditionally a lot of this budget has gone into supporting the military, purchasing equipment, machinery, and paying salaries. In recent years, more money has been set-aside for defense contractors, who in turn provide products and services to the Federal Government. In 2016, nearly half of the defense budget was allocated to defense contractors. The biggest beneficiaries included Lockheed Martin- $36.2 billion, Boeing- $24.3 billion, Raytheon- $12.8 billion, General Dynamics- $12.7 billion, and Northrop Grumman- $10.7 billion (Hartung, 2017). A more detailed table of the defense sector follows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SSL Labs Rating Woes</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/ssl-labs-rating-woes/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/ssl-labs-rating-woes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently notified that one of the sites I support was getting a &amp;lsquo;C&amp;rsquo; rating on SSL Labs. It turned out that there were three main issues that needed to be resolved. Two out of the three were relatively easy to find via the SSL Labs documentation, which required simple fixes to the ssl.conf file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This server is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. If possible, disable SSL 3 to mitigate&lt;/strong&gt;. This was relatively easy to fix. I resolved it by modifying ssl_protocols in the &lt;strong&gt;ssl.conf&lt;/strong&gt; file - thank you Digital Ocean for your &lt;strong&gt;comprehensive write-up&lt;/strong&gt; on this!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The server does not support Forward Secrecy with the reference browsers&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, more simple changes in the ssl.conf file. In case you run into a similar issue, be sure to read this helpful article, &lt;strong&gt;Configuring Apache, Nginx, and OpenSSL for Forward Secrecy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third issue, however, was not quite as straightforward: &lt;strong&gt;This server accepts RC4 cipher, but only with older protocols&lt;/strong&gt;. I found a number of helpful articles on this stating that by adding !RC4 to exclude RC4 in SSLCipherSuite, will result in mitigation of this vulnerability. I spent quite a bit of time trying different cypher list combinations and always including !RC4, however no matter how many times I tweak this, restart httpd and revisit SSL Labs, I kept getting the annoying &amp;lsquo;B&amp;rsquo; grade and RC4 complaint. For anyone facing similar issues, I highly recommend reading Hardening Your Web Server’s SSL Ciphers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior to any cyber attack, an organization should already have a solid crisis management plan and set of disaster recovery precautions in place. In addition to this, a risk analysis should be carried out involving a holistic approach and careful investigation of information systems and the overall environment. The purpose of such an analysis is to evaluate all endpoints that could potentially fail in a disaster or cyber-attack. (Pfleeger &amp;amp; Pfleeger, 2007) The analysis should describe the current state of an organization’s security approaches and examine areas of the company’s infrastructure as well as external factors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency is virtual currency or digital currency that is designed to be used as a medium of exchange to make secure transactions. It does not have any centralized control and there isn’t any regulatory authority as opposite of banks and electronic money. Its control works as a blockchain that is a distributed ledger. The technical system that is base of cryptocurrency was created by an unknown person or a group named Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2017 thousands of cryptocurrencies were created, most of them were like Bitcoin. Is the system of cryptocurrencies the balance and safety of ledgers are managed by miners which are a community of distrustful parties. Miners get a financial benefit for maintaining the security.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Organizations continue to struggle with policies and processes to effectively secure their infrastructure to protect their information assets and intellectual property. In recent years, we have seen the increase of cyber-attacks and breaches to the point that they have become common news worldwide. As systems have grown in complexity with increased capacity to store large amounts of data, so to has the appeal of targeting such systems by cyber criminals. Traditional approaches of defense including signature-based detection, behavioral-based detection, and defense in depth strategies are not enough to protect against advanced distributed attacks and zero-day attacks. Current technologies used to detect traffic, whether packet-based, time-based, or behavior-based, can provide some level of defense. Unfortunately, however as our tools and techniques improve, so too do the accuracy and advancements in sophisticated attackers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress is the most powerful content management system. According to analytics tools, WP powers 30% of websites running on the internet. WP is a popular and user-friendly CMS. It is written in PHP and uses MySQL to save data. Unlike scripting languages such as JAVA EE, ASP, PHP is easy to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared hosting companies offer a 1-click WP installer tool. If you use this tool, you can launch a new website within few minutes. Configuring DNS server and the web server isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. To make sure that your new website is found by search engines and internet users, you must do the below things:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability assessments can be a very effective way of gathering information on an organizations internal security posture. The purpose is to accumulate data on any weaknesses revealed that should be proactively mitigated to prevent exploitation. There are a number of tools that can be used to carry out vulnerability assessments. Typically, a software-based tools are used to scan a selected part of an organizations infrastructure. This can range from specific areas that are exposed to the public, to entire sections of the organizations network (Cima, 2001) lists four of the most common types of vulnerability scanner. These include network-based scanning tools, host-based scanning tools, database scanning tools, and wardialers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What are Advanced Persistent Threats?</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/what-are-advanced-persistent-threats/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/what-are-advanced-persistent-threats/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are security threats that use advanced techniques to hide their attack from their target. They are commonly used to target specific information in high-profile companies and governments. APTs usually follow a long-term strategy of attack in order to gather information from the breached system. There have been many examples of APTs over the years targeting well known organizations. In 2013 the Mandiant report revealed evidence that a specific Chinese military unit has been behind many major Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) within the United States. Since then APTs have been used against large companies including Yahoo, Google, Northrop Grumman, and many others. One of the most complex APTs in recent years was the Stuxnet computer worm (“Stuxnet: Advanced Persistent Threat - Ran Levi,” n.d.), which targeted Iran’s nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a developer, knowledge of web application security vulnerabilities is essential in order to build software that is both resilient to attacks and protected through a layered approach of defense. The cybersecurity landscape is constantly shifting, however a good understanding of the most common vulnerabilities is a great place to get started with security. Before reviewing the articles below, be sure to look at 10 Most Common Security Vulnerabilities. The list that follows are a handful of articles I&amp;rsquo;ve written over the years both in my graduate and professional work. They focus on application security specifically as well as an understanding of the people behind such attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Just What Exactly is Cybersecurity Anyway?</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/just-what-exactly-is-cybersecurity-anyway/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/just-what-exactly-is-cybersecurity-anyway/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The word Cybersecurity is thrown around so much these days it has almost become overused in many conversations. This is due to the vast number of topics associated with its meaning. So how can we define it better? Traditionally Cybersecurity has described as a process for securing information or assets owned by governments, organizations, and individual people. The term itself can be considered a discipline that drives security initiatives and categorizes risks, vulnerabilities, and threats. (Assante &amp;amp; Tobey, 2011) describe Cybersecurity as people (both defenders and attackers), engaged in a contest of playing out on a field of information systems and technology. Cybersecurity influences organizational processes, policies and overall strategy through principles and frameworks. This better informs and fosters the awareness of threats, management of risk, and development of resilient multi-layered security systems. Homeland Security describes the importance of cybersecurity in protecting infrastructure that is vulnerable to a wide range of risk stemming from both physical and cyber threats and hazards (“Cybersecurity Overview,” n.d.). These threats can include internal personnel within an organization, external people, and natural threats such as electricity outages. Within the organization, employees are typically categorized as the highest threat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is an Asymmetric Threat?</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/what-is-an-asymmetric-threat/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/what-is-an-asymmetric-threat/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The term asymmetric refers to an unequal balance or when thinking about threats, an unfair advantage to the perpetrator. Phillips, A (2012) provided an excellent overview of what an asymmetric threat is. He described attacks of this nature to be undetectable, and once occurred, impossible to determine its origin. Rubin (2007) further elaborates on this concept by defining the term asymmetry as that which focuses on placing one strength against an adversary’s weaknesses, even when the overall forces may favor the adversary. This is opposed to traditional combative threats, which require much more planning, financial means and well-coordinated execution through military groups.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Like other top web servers, Nginx lets webmasters enable Gzip compression for their websites. It can compress scripts and stylesheets in a web page on the fly. The Gzip file&amp;rsquo;s size is significantly lower than the original file. Nginx supports 9 Gzip compression levels.1 is the lowest and 9 is the highest. To gzip a file, Nginx will use invoke a function and the function will use system resources during the file conversion process. The function will take few milliseconds to execute.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of business continuity planning is to ensure continued operations of an organization in the event of a catastrophic event, whether this may be a natural disaster or something more sinister. In recent years, we have seen the increase of cyber-attacks and breaches to the point that they have become common news worldwide. As systems have grown in complexity and capacity to store large amounts of data, so too has the appeal of targeting such systems by cyber criminals. In order to meet these challenges head on, business organizations must adapt and implement a comprehensive business continuity plan. Cerullo and Cerullo (2004) describe a business continuity plan as dynamic and evolving as the business environment changes and its dependency on advanced technology changes. They go on to describe three interdependent objectives which include identification of major risks, development of a plan to mitigate or reduce impact of risks, and testing and training. While there is no single recipe to the ideal continuity plan, stakeholders across the organization must play a role in building out a framework for business continuity management that can be used to mitigate major risks while maintaining ‘business as usual’ in the event of a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Business continuity planning in any organization today must incorporate aspects of computer forensics in order to be sustainable. According to Majore, Yoo &amp;amp; Shon (2014) in their article on secure and reliable electronic record management, over 90% of records created today are electronic. In addition to this electronic records require a greater amount of maintenance due to their volatility and dependence on reliable hardware and software. In continuity planning, organizations must face these challenges head on and prepare strategies that integrate digital forensics disciplines into their underlying processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Computer forensics can play a vital role in an organization’s recovery from a cyber attack. By properly following forensics processes carefully in the aftermath of an attack, recovery can begin to play out. According to Čisar &amp;amp; Maravić Čisar (2012), in accordance with digital forensic analysis methodology three processes are essential, which include preparation, identification, and analysis. It is during these processes that a post-mortem analysis occurs including file system, event logs, and recovery of deleted files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Malicious Code Detection</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/malicious-code-detection/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Malicious code detection is an ongoing obfuscation-deobfuscation game because of the nature of the malware or goals of the attacker. Detection of malicious executables known to an investigator is usually performed using signature-based techniques. In their forensic research article, Rozenberg, Guides, Elovici and Fledel (2010) made the point that obfuscated or encrypted files could not easily be detected this way. Instead they recommended a behavioral approach to real time detection. As hackers continue to find new and more advanced techniques to encrypt and hide malicious code, security personnel will have to continue to upgrade their skills and toolsets used in investigations, resulting in an ongoing obfuscation-deobfuscation game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remote Access Trojans have become a serious security concern as hackers have developed more sophisticated code that can be installed and hidden on a target system, unknown to the user. According to UMUC (n.d.) Remote Access Trojans are a form of backdoor that can provide unauthorized access and use of digital assets on a victim’s computer system. It essentially masquerades as a legitimate application. They allow hackers to perform a number of malicious tasks such as stealing information from a system, or installing other malicious software.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to increase traffic to blog for free?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting a new blog is easy but making it popular is difficult. People find blogging as one of the easiest ways to make money online. Well, making money through a blog is not a piece of cake. Only websites getting decent traffic generate revenue for their owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful blogger is one who earns enough money only to feed his family and pay internet and web hosting bills. Frankly speaking, the website&amp;rsquo;s fate depends on the traffic. If a site is getting traffic, it will make money for the owner. If it hardly gets visitors, it is of no use to the owner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Presenting Digital Evidence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Testifying and writing a report are both essential ingredients to a successful digital forensics investigation. Digital forensics personnel will potentially spend months of time working with complex data and processes. The delivery and result of this work is reflected in the forensics report and then ultimately testified in court. Cohen (2012) discussed the report as integral to the overall investigation. Evidence, analysis, interpretation, and attribution, must ultimately be presented in the form of expert reports, depositions, and testimony. The report will present the data captured during the investigation in a way that can be communicated with other people. In addition to this, it serves as a living record that will be referenced and updated throughout the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Confusion over Terminology</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/confusion-over-terminology/</link>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/confusion-over-terminology/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The terms risk, vulnerability and threat are often confusing and sometime interchangeable leading to a lack of understanding when presenting evidence. Risks are usually based on a probability that a threat of some kind will exploit a vulnerability or weakness in a system or network. In recent years risks have been taken more seriously with many businesses that conduct online activities. Vulnerabilities as mentioned above are typically weaknesses that can be exploited by an attacker. This can include anything from poorly configured software and firewalls to badly written pieces of code that can affect secrecy, integrity and control of data and functionality within a system. Bergeron et al. (2001).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to test WordPress plugins online without installing?</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/how-to-test-wordpress-plugins-online-without-installing/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/how-to-test-wordpress-plugins-online-without-installing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If your site is getting good traffic, and if a new version of the plugin you&amp;rsquo;re using has been launched, you&amp;rsquo;ll have the following two questions in the mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will the plugin break your site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the plugin worth installing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the plugins are thoroughly tested before launch, it may have some bugs. If you install the update, your site may crash or it may add HTML code which may affect your site&amp;rsquo;s ranking in Google or Bing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to disable or noindex WordPress attachment pages?</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/how-to-disable-or-noindex-wordpress-attachment-pages/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Attachment page is the built-in feature of WordPress. When these pages are not handled correctly by the website owner, Google and other search engines will index them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress attachments are thin pages that don&amp;rsquo;t add any value to a blog. These pages should be used only on personal or photography blogs wherein you want the visitors to comment on the pictures, videos, and other media files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide an option to turn off or disable these pages. However, you can use third-party plugins to manage them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned using Drupal’s Domain Access Module</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/lessons-learned-using-drupals-domain-access-module/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/lessons-learned-using-drupals-domain-access-module/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months my team has been developing microsites to accompany our main website. The requirements for these sites included having their own domain, theme and separate content. After reviewing options in Drupal 7, I decided the best approach given our situation was to use the Domain Access Module. The Domain Access Module provides a very solid and powerful framework for developing additional sites within your existing Drupal CMS, but it can also be somewhat complicated to setup for any given use case. I have documented some of the lessons learned over the last few months as we implemented Domain Access in our own project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Data Hiding and Steganography</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/data-hiding-and-steganography/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The term ‘Steganography’ refers to ‘covered writing’ and encompasses methods of transmitting secret messages through innocuous cover carriers in a manner that their existence is undetectable. Johnson &amp;amp; Jojodia (1998). For years hackers have been finding more innovative ways of hiding data within existing systems usually for the purpose of transporting it to a target destination. The term ‘carrier’ often refers to a type of common file that covert information can be embedded in unknowingly to anyone else. Kessler (2007) discusses the fact that any form of digital information can be stored inside many types of carrier files, including image, audio, video and executable files. Digital forensics tools can be used to scan carriers to determine whether or not suspicious information lies underneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Preparation Phase of a Digital Search</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/preparation-phase-of-a-digital-search/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The preparation phase of digital search is the most important phase of the digital investigation process. If not carried out correctly, the can lead to improper handling of evidence that may lead to damage of crucial materials to an investigation. This phase involves the preparation of tools, techniques, search warrants, and monitoring authorizations and management support. Venansius &amp;amp; Tushabe (2004). It is therefore important that adequate resources are allocated to the preparation phase. Beebe &amp;amp; Clark (2007) elaborate more on this phase as the process of preparing tools and equipment, honing forensics skills, and continuing to become educated about on new technologies and tools that may be useful in dealing with the incident.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Important Cybercrime Laws</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/important-cybercrime-laws/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of cybercrime laws that are extremely important in the field of digital forensics and cybersecurity as a whole. Two of the most important laws include the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) of 1984 and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original intent of CFAA was to address computer related crimes and more specifically protect information assets. The law made it a federal crime to gain unauthorized access to data or information on protected computer systems. It does not come without criticism. Kerr (2009) made many points that the current law is too vague stating that CFAA has become so broad, and computers so common, that expansive or uncertain interpretations of unauthorized access will render it unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the law has been a cornerstone for shaping the way we deal with cybercrime and since its introduction, has been since amended a number of times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Yet More Theft of Information Assets</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/yet-more-theft-of-information-assets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t seem that long ago that I received an official letter in the mail from the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) detailing that sensitive information about me had been compromised. I had been following the news and knew about the breach, so the letter didn’t come as a huge shock. It did make me think about the impact of such a breach, originally reported as affecting 4 million individuals, later estimated to have compromised sensitive information of 21.5 million. Christensen et al (2015). Just this past week I once again learned, along with the majority of the country, that with high probability my identity along with millions of others had been stolen in another data breach. It has since come to light that the cause of the breach was unpatched systems affected by Apache’s open-source Struts software, a vulnerability that should have been mitigated months before the breach took place. Brandom (2017).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though I have a technical background, I was not comfortable in moving my sites during my initial days of online career. At that time, 2 of my biggest worries were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorrect site configuration can lead to tons of soft 404 or 404 errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If DNS isn&amp;rsquo;t configured correctly, search bots and visitors would fail to access my sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my online journey in May 2013. I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my hosting platform and moved my websites several times in the last four years without losing website traffic. Right now, my websites are hosted on an unmanaged Linode cloud server. Before switching to Linode, I used Digital Ocean. To move my sites, I follow the below steps:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There are a couple of plugins that enable you to move settings from AIOSEO to Yoast. Unfortunately, none of the plugins provide an option to bulk move noindex posts. People noindex posts to recover from Google quality updates or prevent penalty during an algorithm update.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A directory site has a massive listing of businesses. If a site is successful, it will have a listing of 1000+ business. A small site may have fewer listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEO plays a key role in deciding the fate of a directory site. A well-optimized website will rank high in search engines. A good example of this is Yelp, a large restaurant directory site that ranks at number 1 position in Google SERPs for several 1000 keywords. We must not forget that Yelp has 100s of employees working 24 x 7.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best way to Auto Tag WordPress posts</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/best-way-to-auto-tag-wordpress-posts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress tags are important, no matter how small or large a site is. Tags allow users to group posts. They make website navigation easier. They allow search engines to discover and index new posts quickly. WordPress Related posts plugins use tags to calculate post relevancy and display related articles below blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings make mistakes. Sometimes, a webmaster may delete an important tag unintentionally. Once a tag is removed, the structure of the related post on your site may change. If you have a small blog with 10 to 20 posts, readding tags manually shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem. If you own a large site, readding tags to posts is an annoying task. The best way to add tags to blog posts is to use Automatic Post Tagger WordPress plugin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started my online career with a site hosted on Godaddy. I switched to A Small Orange from Godaddy after finding its plans cheap. After a major DNS incident, I quit ASO and bought shared hosting plan from Hostgator. HG shared plans are great for growing sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traffic to my site grew and I had launched a few more sites. To make sure that HG doesn&amp;rsquo;t ban my sites by high server resource usage, I bought unmanaged Hostgator VPS plan. The VPS had 512 MB RAM. Everything was going great. When I was holidaying at my native place, my sites were down for 8 hours. To find the reason for this, I logged into the server to go through PHP, Nginx, MySQL log, and system log files. The system log file had several &amp;ldquo;MYSQL server has gone away&amp;rdquo; entries. This problem occurs when the system doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough free memory for MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re serious about your restaurant business, you must use the WordPress CMS. WP allows you to create an incredibly powerful restaurant website within 50 to 55 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re planning to start a food blog or you already own a food blog, your objective should be to get as many loyal visitors as you can and make money from the site without affecting the visitor experience. To get desired results, you must use a powerful and SEO friendly food blog theme. One of the best templates for the recipe sites is Foodie Pro.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

PayPal is the first choice of many freelancers, bloggers, etc. But in the last 2 to 3 years, Payoneer has emerged as a great alternative to PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payoneer is a reliable service and many leading marketing services support it. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve received about $200 without any hassles. I&amp;rsquo;m using this payment service to receive commissions from Amazon Associates US, ThemeForest, and ShareASale affiliate programs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/fix-remove-query-strings-from-static-resources-warning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I was checking the performance of one of my sites with GTmetrix and Pingdom tools. Although my site takes about 1 second to open in any browser, the tools were reporting remove query strings from static resources warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything that follows after the question mark i.e &amp;ldquo;?&amp;rdquo; is called a query string. You&amp;rsquo;ll find URLs with query strings on dynamic sites. If the site serves static content, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to use them. The website I&amp;rsquo;m talking about is a small blog. Hence, I decided to get rid of the warning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in my earlier blog post, I am using LetsEncrypt free SSL certificate on one of my sites. The certificate was due to expire in few weeks. The CertBot dispatched an alert message for the same on my official email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m using SSL for the first time and having several doubts in mind, I decided to renew LetsEncrypt certificate immediately. I fired the following command in the Linux terminal (10 days prior the certificate&amp;rsquo;s expiry date) and restarted Nginx.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A theme is responsible for the success of a blogger. Many bloggers end up buying a theme which looks attractive but scores 0 when it comes to SEO. Despite publishing high-quality content on their sites, these bloggers don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy success and they quit blogging&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a newbie blogger, I had committed a huge mistake of trusting a third class theme developer. The developer rolled out an update which created the dreaded duplicate title, meta description problem on my site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Letsencrypt review: Should you use free SSL certificate?</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/letsencrypt-review-should-you-use-free-ssl-certificate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After Google declared HTTPS as a ranking signal, thousands of sites have switched to HTTPS from HTTP. To secure your site with HTTPS, you must install an SSL certificate on the server and configure the web server to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt Certificate Authority was launched in 2016, companies used to charge a hefty amount for providing SSL certificates. Now, you can easily get free SSL certificates to secure your personal or business portal, thanks to Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is the best WordPress permalink structure for SEO?</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/what-is-the-best-wordpress-permalink-structure-for-seo/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/what-is-the-best-wordpress-permalink-structure-for-seo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress saves the permalink of the page/post in a database table. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t generate them on the fly. Hence, you can change the structure of the post/page URL anytime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should avoid changing permalinks often because it complicates your site. When you change the URL structure, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to redirect the old URL to the newer URL with a proper HTTP status code. If you don&amp;rsquo;t implement the redirect correctly, your site&amp;rsquo;s traffic from search engines will decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you may want to display widgets only on certain pages of a site. If you&amp;rsquo;ve knowledge of PHP, you can show/hide widgets with just 2 lines of codes. The 1st line will have the PHP if else condition to detect the current page or term. If the condition you&amp;rsquo;ve specified in the if statement is true, then the code inside the if block must be executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The block must have the shortcode or code to display the required widget. It is the 2nd line of our code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Site deindexed from Google is the worst nightmare for any blogger or business owner. When Google removes your site from its index, your AdSense earnings are down by 70 to 90%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If traffic from social networks to your site is high, you can recover the earnings by becoming an affiliate marketer. If your site doesn&amp;rsquo;t get good traffic from Facebook, Twitter or any other social site, your website will be of no use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to Google, HTTPS is a ranking signal. If you make your website secure by configuring the web server to deliver HTTPS pages, your site may rank higher than an HTTP only portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, web browsers have begun to warn their users of non-secure web pages. The Google Chrome browser (version 56) marks non-https website pages as insecure when they have an HTML field for entering passwords, credit or debit card details, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Setting a preferred domain is one of the most important things to do after launching a new site. It takes few seconds to set a PD. Before setting a preferred domain, you should make sure that Google indexes only the URLS which you want to appear in search results. To do so, you must set up a 301 redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 301 redirect will prevent duplicate content issues. It will tell search engines that they should index the correct web pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HTTPS protocol makes your website secure. Google had declared HTTPS as a ranking signal last year which means that secure sites can have higher organic visibility than nonsecure websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your site is selling products online, you&amp;rsquo;ll see a boost in conversion because the browsers will mark your website as safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you go ahead and enable HTTPS on your website, you must learn the Google Content Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you enable HTTP secure protocol, Google will crawl and index all HTTPS URLS it finds on your website. It then checks the HTTP version of the URLS to learn whether the webmaster has implemented proper redirects or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in one of our blog posts, duplicate content is not good for the site&amp;rsquo;s health. When Google refreshes the Panda Algorithm, the search traffic of sites with duplicate content are affected the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webmasters with experience of creating search engine friendly sites by following the Google Webmaster Guidelines take care of content issues caused by the content management system. But they can&amp;rsquo;t identify scrapped content unless their site&amp;rsquo;s search engine traffic is impacted by a Google Algorithm Update.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best WordPress widgets for your blog (2018)</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/best-wordpress-widgets-for-your-blog-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Widgets are one of the most impressive and powerful features of the WordPress content management system. They make your website look attractive and user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you install WordPress, the CMS will add up to 10 different widgets to your blog or website. These widgets have limited functionality. Furthermore, they&amp;rsquo;re not customizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free themes may not add new widgets to your WP site. To add a new widget, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to install a new WP plugin. As a blogger, you should know that too many plugins may slow down your website. If the plugin is badly programmed, it will lead to high server resource consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Themes and plugins are the most important parts of a WordPress website. If the code of the theme is not SEO friendly, your site will not perform well in search engines. Likewise, if the plugin has an erroneous code, it can lead to poor user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In worst cases, the problematic theme or plugin may cause high server resource utilization. The search bots will begin to ignore your site. If you don&amp;rsquo;t fix the problem ASAP, the site&amp;rsquo;s rankings will tank.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;You can run WordPress on your PC by installing the NGINX, PHP-FPM, MySQL stack on your PC. The website deployed on localhost is accessible through an IP address. If you want your WordPress blog to be accessible from computers or mobile devices across the world, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to buy a domain name.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Guys, you may have seen the &amp;ldquo;Leverage browser caching&amp;rdquo; warning when you test your website&amp;rsquo;s speed with the Google page speed insights tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finding this message, you head over to Google and search methods to increase cache expiry time. After reading a tutorial on increasing expiry time for static content i.e. JavaSript, CSS files, you go ahead and modify the htaccess or Nginx configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know that if you set an abnormal expiration value to the static files (say 30 days or more), you may be committing a big mistake!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bluetooth connectivity has grown immensely in popularity with mobile devices in the last number of years. The convenience factor of being able to have a hands-free experience with a mobile phone while driving or out and about has fueled this growth. Unfortunately, like all conveniences there are typically downsides. In the case of Bluetooth, there have been a number of  vulnerabilities detected over the last number of years ranging from mobile device viruses to attacks on devices from attackers.  In their 2006 publication, Bose &amp;amp; Shin discussed the negative impact of viruses specifically designed to target Bluetooth enabled mobile devices. Their paper discussed the pitfalls of these types of malware that could be spread via SMS/MMS messages and by exploiting Bluetooth vulnerabilities. They analyzed these viruses in order build detection and containment systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The use of mobile devices including policies and employee restrictions should be considered in any modern network security architecture. Mobile devices are used commonly both at home and at work with some organizations managing BYOD (Bring your Own Device) policies. It is therefore important to consider the implications of this and to ensure any BYOD device is properly locked down, authorized and managed within the corporate network. Westervelt (2010) published an article several years ago on the high amount of vulnerabilities discovered within mobile devices. Many of which were reminiscent of earlier / legacy web application issues. Homeland Security Newswire published an article on the ‘new’ cybersecurity threat of smartphone apps that do more than they say they do in terms of hidden malware and other threats. n.d.

It shows ratings only for the portals having schema markups and in-depth content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing the content is up to the user, but one can easily add schema codes to their site by referring the official guidelines. Modern content management systems provide extensions to add review boxes to their site and add the Schema markup code for the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Amazon is counted among the most trusted brands in the world. It has listings of more than a million products. The products include household items, accessories for mobile devices, cameras, etc. They have a competitive price tag due to which people don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate in buying expensive or inexpensive stuff from Amazon. Hence, the more traffic you send to Amazon, the higher will be the conversions. I can say this from my personal experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What are Covert Channels?</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/what-are-covert-channels/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A covert storage channel occurs when illegitimate hidden information or data is sent secretly via a legitimate communication channel. The process occurs through the manipulation of communications medium in an unconventional way in order to transmit data that is unseen in everyday operations. Thyer (2008). An example of a covert storage channel involves the hiding of data in ICMP error echoing functionality. OWASP (n.d.). Due to the specification, data can be sent to cause a host to leek information or provide verbose error messages potentially revealing sensitive operating system information. This type of covert channel could lead to gaining knowledge of vulnerabilities and possible future attacks. It can be mitigated by clearing out all reserved fields prior to transmission to ensure no sensitive data is leaked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently sent an article titled ‘How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016’. Aguinaga, J. (2016).  It is a somewhat amusing take on the current state of JavaScript frameworks and libraries available to web developers and how this environment is changing so quickly. All quirks aside, modern application frameworks provide us with much interactivity and web functionality we take for granted. The modern web browser has to cope with these advancements and continue to evolve to meet the demands of its users and developers. In the Federal government and other organizations that are not able to update their software systems to keep up with the pace, libraries called polyfills have been created to add functionality to legacy browsers that were never designed to run such rich modern web applications. Modernizr is one of the most popular HTML5 polyfills available as open source software at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Modernizr&#34;&gt;https://github.com/Modernizr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Web hosting is the backbone of a website. It is crucial to the success of a blogger, business, and the website. A poor web hosting firm will have big downtimes. Because of poor infrastructure, the network latency will be high and your site will rank below faster websites in the search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web hosting services are of three types, shared, VPS, dedicated, and cloud. The shared hosting plans are the cheapest of the three. They are ideal for small sites owned by newbie webmasters and beginners. VPS and dedicated plans are costly as compared to shared. They are suitable for business or larger websites owned by experienced webmasters. Cloud platforms are suitable for websites whose traffic may explode anytime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I have addressed one major issue the WordPress users face i.e. HTTP error on uploading media or image files. I encountered this error yesterday while trying to upload a picture in my latest blog post. The picture uploader tool was repeatedly throwing cannot upload error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I logged into the server and checked PHP error log files generated by the website and PHP web server. The files were clean. I checked WP memory limit in the wp-config.php file. The memory allocated to my site was 64 megabytes and all my sites were using 15% of the allocated system memory. Hence, I ruled out the low memory issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People spend more time on mobile phones than computers. Google Engineers realized this a few years back and they made several changes to core Algorithm. They introduced a mobile-friendly testing tool for webmasters and launched page layout algorithm which affects rankings of ad-heavy desktop/mobile sites. In 2016, Google launched a new concept called Accelerated Mobile Pages. After testing AMP on a bunch of top news website, Google now allows all websites to use AMP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Syn Flood or Denial of Service Attack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syn Flood attacks, often referred to as Denial of Service Attacks are caused through exploitation of the TCP protocol. The attacker sends a large number of TCP/SYN packets using a forged address. Because of this, the destination server is unable to successfully establish a proper connection due to the source being unreachable. Lawrence (n.d.). Each time the server attempts to establish a connection, resources are used up with the flooding of packets causing eventual slow down or non-responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What are Rogue Access Points?</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/what-are-rogue-access-points/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WiFi is commonly used both within organizations and in the general public. In recent years attackers have discovered ways to lure victims by using rogue access points. These are essentially wireless access points that have been installed in a network without authorization. In some cases these may have been installed by employees of an organization for convenience reasons, however this in itself is a security risk. More often than not, an employee who has installed such a device would most likely not have secured it correctly potentially leaving the network open to attack. On the other hand attackers deliberately install a rogue access points in order to deliberately target the network. This can be done through a series of vulnerability testing or scanning once they have access.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using jQuery.AJAX() to Retrieve Sample JSON Data</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/using-jquery.ajax-to-retrieve-sample-json-data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally the X in AJAX has usually equated XML (eXtensive Markup Notation). In recent years, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has taken over in many cases due to its overall efficiency and ease of use. In general, JSON is a much less verbose syntax, which has gained a lot of popularity in modern JavaScript frameworks. Part of this popularity can be attributed to the fact that JSON data can be parsed quicker and because it&amp;rsquo;s less verbose, less bandwidth is needed to transmit it back and forth. In this overview we will look at how easy it is to get up and running consuming JSON data using the popular jQuery library.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to fix White Screen of Death Problem?</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/how-to-fix-white-screen-of-death-problem/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like the Blue screen of death error, the WSOD is the most commonly reported error. The white screen problem occurs because of few lines of code crashing the entire application. Experienced programmers can fix the issue in a few minutes. If a novice user who hired a freelancer or uses a content management system sees the white screen, he should follow the below two methods to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wsod-in-sites-other-than-cms&#34;&gt;WSOD in sites other than CMS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see the white screen of death, the first thing you should do is check log files. Unless you change the path of log files in the server&amp;rsquo;s config file, the web and DB server creates log files in the /var/ directory in Linux. In most of the cases, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the root cause problem for the WSOD problem in these files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google has indexed over a billion web pages. It is the largest search engine in the world. Millions of sites depend on traffic from Google to earn revenue. Hence, when engineers working at Google roll out a new update, the SEO experts are excited and equally worried hoping that their or client sites don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo; lose traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days back, the head of webspam at Google revealed that the much awaited Penguin 4.0 algorithm update is now in action. The Algoroo graph indicated massive fluctuations in search engine results starting from September 1. It seems like Google began testing the Penguin 4.0 update from 1st September onward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wireshark is a software application for protocol and network traffic analysis, also known as a network sniffer. The application can be downloaded for free at https://www.wireshark.org/#download. I downloaded Wireshark from the url and selected the macOS 10.6 .dmg file. I was able to successfully mount the download image and run the package installer which kept all the default settings with the following installed in my system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;/Applications/Wireshark.app&lt;/em&gt;. The main Wireshark application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.wireshark.ChmodBPF.plist&lt;/em&gt;. A launch daemon that adjusts permissions on the system&amp;rsquo;s packet capture devices (&lt;em&gt;/dev/bpf&lt;/em&gt;*) when the system starts up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;/Library/Application Support/Wireshark/ChmodBPF&lt;/em&gt; A copy of the launch daemon property list, and the script that the launch daemon runs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/em&gt;. A wrapper script and symbolic links which will let you run Wireshark and its associated utilities from the command line. You can access them directly or by adding /usr/local/bin to your PATH if it&amp;rsquo;s not already in your PATH.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s that time of year again where I decided to enroll in another Cybersecurity class at UMUC. I will be posting snippets from the class over the next few weeks. This week TCP Congestion Control was one of the topics I was looking at and so this post will serve as a high level overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCP Congestion Control is the process of monitoring and controlling network traffic in order to avoid congestion, which could lead to potential loss of packets and / or poor transmission rates. It determines the available capacity on the network and in turn is equipped with the information needed to know the number of packets that can be safely transmitted. Congestion control maintain a state variable for each connection called a congestion window, which is used to determine limits on the amount of data that can be sent at any given time. The size of the limits defined in this window change accordingly based on congestion levels via the process of the additive increase/multiplicative decrease (AIMD) algorithm. AIMD essentially lowers the limits of the congestion window when there is less congestion and raises them when congestion levels have increased.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress is a great content management system because it allows users to launch a new self-hosted blog or website within half an hour. Launching a site is easy but you&amp;rsquo;ll not make money with it if the site doesn&amp;rsquo;t get decent traffic from search engines. To make sure that the site is SEO friendly, you must write good quality content, buy a good hosting plan, and purchase a premium theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SEO is not a child&amp;rsquo;s play. One wrong setting can impact search engine rankings dramatically. Although WordPress is a decade old CMS and powers millions of sites, it is still suffering from various SEO issues. To fix the problem, the must install one of the 100s of SEO plugins available in the WordPress repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should not install plugins which have poor ratings and promise plenty of features. I did the same mistake in the past and I still regret it. In the year 2013, my site lost 90 to 95% organic traffic because of a bad WordPress SEO plugin. Today, the best SEO plugins provide plenty of useful features. They let users optimize their site for higher local search rankings, add breadcrumbs to the website, add XML sitemaps, etc. Moreover, they work great.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A log file generated by a web/database server is one of the most important files. It contains useful information on visitors, errors, warnings, etc. Some people think log files as server resource killer. Hence, they disable them in Apache, DB or NGINX configuration file. One more reason why people disable or ignore server logs is because the content of logs is difficult to understand. Hence, most noob webmasters use a log file analyzer program to check server logs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The black background of the text editor soothes my eyes. The text color is great and the interface of the Atom editor is awesome. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like the default Look and Feels, you are free to change it as per your preference or download a new Atom theme. My favorite color is black so I don&amp;rsquo;t find it necessary to change the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atom editor gets updates on a regular basis. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve started using the editor, GitHub has rolled out many updates. Each update makes the editor better. I&amp;rsquo;m interested only in code. Hence, I haven&amp;rsquo;t checked the full features of Atom editor. For me, Atom is the best tool for web development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Preparing for the Acquia Certified Developer Exam Drupal 8</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/preparing-for-the-acquia-certified-developer-exam-drupal-8/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Acquia Certified Developer exam Drupal 8 just launched a couple of months ago. I was interested in studying for this exam as I have been working in Drupal 8 for the last six months and future projects look most likely to be Drupal 8 based. I had looked at the various Acquia certification tracks in the past, however I was never fully committed to the Drupal 7 track so I was happy when Acquia announced first the Foundations and then later the Certified Developer exams. I took the Foundations exam first and found that while I was weaker in my front-end Drupal 8 skills, I managed to pass. Later when I sat for the Certified Developer exam I realized there was a bit of cross over in terms of the questions, in fact I think a few of them were taken directly from the foundations exam. I would recommend anyone considering the Certified Developer exam to first take Foundations as it will give you a good idea of the type of questions to expect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is BlogSpot or Blogger safe, better than WordPress?</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/is-blogspot-or-blogger-safe-better-than-wordpress/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Blogspot and blogger are the two faces of the same coin. Blogger was known as Blogspot but when Google bought it, people started calling the site Blogger. Google hasn&amp;rsquo;t destroyed Blogspot. Sites that are hosted on it are identified by the following domain name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;site_name.blogspot.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;is-blogspot-safe&#34;&gt;Is BlogSpot safe?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Google owns Blogger, it is a much safer website than a self-hosted WP blog. If you enable two-factor authentication, it will be impossible for a hacker to take over your site because blogger asks users to enter their Gmail password to log into their profile. All websites powered by Google are secure. Have you ever heard that Gmail or Google got hacked?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google penalizes spammy EMD sites, but do you know that Exact match domain names can outrank an authority site for a specific keyword? If you don&amp;rsquo;t know this, you are probably a newbie or an immature SEO professional. Here are the three important things that you should know as a Sear Engine Optimization professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;emd-domains-rank&#34;&gt;EMD domains rank&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can give 10 good examples that exact match domain names rank high for the keywords. Google starts ranking EMD sites only after a certain time period. The sites using EMD have 100s of polished articles with an average content length of 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dependency Injection / Service Container Example</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/dependency-injection-/-service-container-example/</link>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/dependency-injection-/-service-container-example/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an earlier post, I outlined the basics of dependency injection and talked a little bit about the Drupal 8 service container and how we can use this in our code. Day 16 of Drupal Activity Cards provides a task for us to implement dependency injection in one of the Drupal 8 Example modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples module is a great resource for developers getting started in Drupal coding. The modules included gives us basic functionality that provides easy to follow starting points for a number of different needs. For our dependency injection example we are going to look at page_example, a simple module for generating a Drupal 8 page via a controller. A function called simple() returns a basic page. We are going to extend this function to provide a log entry every time a use visits this page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I own a laptop which has a dedicated graphics card. I am a developer who prefers using Linux OS. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried 3 distros of Linux, Mint, Ubuntu, OpenSuse. No matter what version of Linux I use, the OS fails to recognize the AMD graphics card in my laptop and the WiFi connection always drops. I fixed the WiFi issue by upgrading the driver but the GPU installation always fails. Hence, I decided to give up using Linux and stick with Windows 10 OS for development tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Logging in Drupal 8</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/logging-in-drupal-8/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/logging-in-drupal-8/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Logging is very important in any production site because we don&amp;rsquo;t have the same ability to debug code that we have in our development environments. Drupal 7 had a very robust logging system called watchdog(), which has been replaced by logger in Drupal 8. This post summarizes a basic use case for logging in Drupal 8 continuing the Drupal 8 Activity Cards series on Day 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amber Matz breaks down logging in Drupal 8 concisely in How to Log Messages in Drupal 8. In her article, she breaks down the code needed to implement logger and provides solid explanations. The examples provided involve procedural coding in the .module file as does the example I provide in this article. If you are writing controllers or forms that extend ControllerBase or FormBase then it would be better to use the service container to inject logger into your code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 has a new theme engine, however many of the concepts we are familiar with in Drupal 7 are still in place in this new version. Themes still have the same ability to overwrite various templates within core, only now instead of modifying .tpl.php files, you will be creating Twig files in their place. Theme functions are still available to use, however they are now kept in the .theme file instead of template.php. Other changes worthy of exploring in more depth are briefly summarized below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 has seen a lot of improvements for content entities and with the new Drupal console, setting up a content entity has been made a lot easier with the addition of boilerplate code generation. Day 11 of the Drupal 8 Activity Card set focuses on content entities, how they can be setup in Drupal 8, how we might add our own custom fields to the boilerplate code provided, and how this is managed within the Drupal 8 administration system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Backlinks or content : What&#39;s more important?</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/backlinks-or-content-whats-more-important/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two of the most commonly used terms by bloggers and webmasters are backlinks and content. A site must have both else it will not rank in first seven pages of world&amp;rsquo;s busiest and largest search engine, Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backlinks aka inbound links are the most important criteria Google considers for ranking content of a website in their pages. One can easily prove this. Search for a product in Google. Popular sites with 1000s of backlinks will occupy first few pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Configuring your Local Drupal 8 Development Environment</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/configuring-your-local-drupal-8-development-environment/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/configuring-your-local-drupal-8-development-environment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have struggled with properly optimizing my local environment in terms of enabling debugging and disabling cache for a while. There isn&amp;rsquo;t that many steps you need to cover in order to have a proper working development environment. After reviewing Day 10 I completed setting up my environment the correct way and have outlined this in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-enable-settingslocalphp&#34;&gt;Step 1 Enable settings.local.php&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy and Rename /sites/settings.example.local.php -&amp;gt; /sites/default/settings.local.php&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncomment the following lines in your settings.php file:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-php&#34; data-lang=&#34;php&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# if (file_exists(__DIR__ . &amp;#39;/settings.local.php&amp;#39;)) {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;#   include __DIR__ . &amp;#39;/settings.local.php&amp;#39;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-2-disable-cache-services&#34;&gt;Step 2 Disable Cache Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your sites/default/settings.local.php file, uncomment the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-php&#34; data-lang=&#34;php&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# $settings[&amp;#39;cache&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;bins&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;render&amp;#39;] = &amp;#39;cache.backend.null&amp;#39;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebuild your site configuration by visiting yoursite.local/rebuild.php&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-3-disabletwig-cache-and-enable-debugging&#34;&gt;Step 3 Disable Twig Cache and Enable Debugging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the following lines to your /sites/development-services.yml (Refer to /sites/default/default-services.yml for all options)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-php&#34; data-lang=&#34;php&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;twig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;auto_reload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear Cache and then verify Twig debugging has been enabled by refreshing your Drupal 8 homepage. Review your source code and you should see something similar to:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-php&#34; data-lang=&#34;php&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;THEME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;DEBUG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;THEME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;HOOK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;html&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;--.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;twig&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;twig&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twig debugging gives a lot of helpful information scattered throughout your source code in the form of comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Attaching JS and CSS Assets in Drupal 8</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/attaching-js-and-css-assets-in-drupal-8/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/attaching-js-and-css-assets-in-drupal-8/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 has introduced a different way of attaching JavaScript and CSS to themes and custom modules via a new concept called libraries, which are covered in Day 9. Libraries are essentially .yml files that define different groups of assets that can later be attached via module code. When I started working with the theme layer in Drupal 8, I quickly realized that certain things are very different from Drupal 7. One of the main gotchas for anyone new to Drupal 8 is the idea that JavaScript libraries are now only loaded where they are needed. In contrast to Drupal 7 where jQuery for example, was loaded on every page, in Drupal 8 jQuery is no longer automatically loaded. This provides for a better optimized site with only the required libraries included in areas that they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of new terminology in Drupal 8 and for anyone not familiar with Object Oriented programming, some of it can be downright confusing. For myself, I have worked with OOP for quite a while, however I have not spent as much time writing custom modules for Drupal 7. While I am familiar on the surface with the hook system and API at a very novice level, I have never really had to do any intense back end development in D7. Now that I am working in Drupal 8, things are quite different with my projects at work. Thankfully my OOP background has filled in some of the gaps, however my lack of Drupal 7 module development knowledge has proven to be a burden.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 7 focuses mainly on the Drupal Queue API. The main resource for this card is an article called Drupal 8 Queue API – Powerful Manual and Cron Queueing, which I had referenced in an earlier post. Before completing any of the materials, I had no previous experience with the Queue API, nor hook_entity_insert, which was used to create a demo queue system in the referenced article. After going through the article I gained a better understanding of how the queue system works. At a high level the following steps outline the process of constructing the module that is documented in this article along with relevant links to the API.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For several years I have worked as an ASP.NET MVC developer and have become intimately familiar with terms such as services and dependency injection and services. It is refreshing to see some of these familiar concepts surfacing in Drupal 8. Day 6 focuses mainly on introducing us to services and dependency injection via several online resources. There is no exercises or tasks in this card as the aim is to simply gain an understanding of some of these concepts. I saw a lot of overlap in terms of syntax and how dependency injection is handled in Drupal 8 compared with Unity and StuctureMap in ASP.NET, so anyone from background or other traditional object oriented languages such as Java will be familiar with a lot of this. I have outlined the main takeaways I got from the Day 6 below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Drupal 8 Migration</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/drupal-8-migration/</link>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/drupal-8-migration/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had some exposure to the migrate module in the past, mostly with Drupal 7 and more recently for a Drupal 8 migration project that required importing of a small (under 1000) set of records stored in a CSV file. Todays D8Card focuses on the new migration module that comes partly with core and also partly in the form of contributed modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;migrate-core--migrate-contrib&#34;&gt;Migrate Core &amp;amp; Migrate Contrib&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of todays set of tasks was to import a couple of small CSV files using migrate and some of the contributed modules. I started out by reviewing the links posted in the card and then proceeded to download and install migrate_tools, migrate_plus, and migrate_source_csv. What comes with Drupal 8 core out of the box is pretty limited and only contains migration functionality for moving content from previous Drupal sites. It definitely makes the upgrade process less painful, however if you want to get into migration code that can manage a multitude of external sources, then you will want to grab to contrib modules above.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among the many changes in Drupal 8, the blocks system received an overhaul, which has improved much of its functionality significantly. Some of the most notable take aways include the new block page layout and UI for updating, adding, and editing blocks, the addition of custom blocks and fieldable types (similar to content types), and integration with display view modes to allow for rendering changes based on block placement. Day 5 directs you to a good introductory video of the new blocks system by the Drupalize.me team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best AdSense alternatives to earn dollars not cents (2018)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AdSense is a great platform for making money online. But getting approved for it or having a five or six figure AdSense revenue is a difficult task. People have a misunderstanding that GA is the only advertiser with which they can make them rich. They are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is predictable in the world of internet. Hence, you should always try out different strategies for maximizing revenue from the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many methods of monetizing a website. This is what I have learned from my 3 years of experience as a blogger. People make a mistake by depending only on AdSense aka a single source for their earnings. They don&amp;rsquo;t experiment with other monetization programs aka AdSense alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This card has us create our first Drupal 8 module, learn about Drupal 8 Form API and learn about the Configuration API. The card starts off with directing you to several Drupal.org documentation pages including Creating a Custom Page,  Defining and using your own configuration in Drupal 8, Providing Default configuration, and Simple Configuration API. Except for the Creating a Custom Page document, everything else here is focused on giving you a solid overview of the configuration system within Drupal 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have to be honest, before completing Day 2 tasks, I had never actually used the Paragraphs module before. I heard others mention it in the past and considered looking at it at some point, however until today I did not realize what I was missing in terms of the power and flexibility that this module has to offer. The d8cards.com Paragraphs Module card begins with directing you to YouTube tutorial by Zane Sensenig, embedded below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-21-day-challenge&#34;&gt;THE 21 DAY CHALLENGE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to learn Drupal 8 for the last couple of months as I was landed in the middle of a D8 project at work. Being involved on the project has taught me a lot about Drupal 8 module development and Symfony in general, however I have started questioning the way I am writing code and if in fact it is the best way or the ‘Drupal’ way. I decided I needed some additional exposure to Drupal 8, not only in terms of module development, but as a platform in its entirety including front-end, configuration as well as back-end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I come from a .NET background where I was spoiled by the ease of use and integration of Visual Studio. Recently much of my development work has moved to the open source and the world of Drupal 8 where I have gotten by until recently with Sublime Text and Atom. Since I have started writing custom modules, I needed a way to effectively debug my code and I had heard good things about the PHP debugger Xdebug. Unfortunately it can be a little tricky to setup, so I have outlined the basic steps I needed to go through using my favorite Vagrant environment Scotchbox. If you are unfamiliar with Scotchbox, check out my earlier posts Scotchbox Vagrant LAMP Stack and Drupal Development Environment in less than 10 Minutes&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to compress or minify HTML of a WordPress site?</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/how-to-compress-or-minify-html-of-a-wordpress-site/</link>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/how-to-compress-or-minify-html-of-a-wordpress-site/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minification is a process of stripping whitespaces and comments of a page. When you minify a web page, the visitors to your website will experience faster browsing experience on their desktop or mobile device. The page speed insights tool will not request you to minify HTML, JS, or CSS code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you minify HTML, CSS or JS code on your website, the server will send a small page to the client. The file size is yet another factor in determining the page speed of a website. The browser on the client device will download a smaller file faster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using Scotchbox for a while now and continue to be impressed by it&amp;rsquo;s simplicity and ease of use compared to other Vagrant environments I have used in the past. Recently I started working on a Drupal 8 project that required the use of a PostGreSQL (PostGres) database. Thankfully, when I checked the Scotchbox 2.0 documentation, it appeared that PostGres came packaged up with the environment and ready to use. After doing a little bit of research I realized I needed to follow a couple of steps in order to get this running properly with a PostGres client. I am outlining the steps below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Yesterday, one of our readers dropped me an email to know which is the best hosting among Bluehost, Justhost, and HostMonster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader was confused because the plans and features offered by the companies are almost the same. I have shared a comparison of JH, HM, and BH in this article to help our readers in buying the best hosting plan for their site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was thinking about registering a new domain name for my new project. My first choice was GoDaddy. I had shortlisted a few TLDs from GoDaddy, but I was not able to buy a domain name for less than 10$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GoDaddy runs a promotion wherein new customers can register a TLD for USD 0.99. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using GoDaddy for three years. Hence, I was not eligible for this offer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A blog post is incomplete without images. Imagine if a site has no photos, will you spend your time going through the content?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A visitor to your website might be impressed with the picture you&amp;rsquo;ve embedded in the blog post. He may want to share the image on social networks. Some users may not waste their time in copying the photo URL by right clicking on the page. They may exit your website and use Google image search to get a link to the picture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2011, Digital Ocean has become one of the most popular cloud VPS hosting services in the world. I recently came to know that Digital Ocean has set up a data center in the country from which my websites get the maximum traffic. I immediately moved my sites from Hostgator VPS to DigitalOcean. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using DO for 21 days now. Here&amp;rsquo;s my review of this unmanaged Linux VPS hosting service.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best Affiliate Link Cloaker Plugin for Wordpress</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Affiliate links are ugly and long. When the user hovers your mouse on an affiliate link and finds your tracking code in the URL, he may not click the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not a seasoned webmaster, you should use a plugin to create and manage affiliate links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GoCodes was one of the best affiliate link Cloaker plugins. I was using it until I update the PHP on my VPS server. Unfortunately, the plugin has become useless because it has not been updated for 2 years. GoCodes will not work on sites using the latest version of PHP because several functions that GoCodes uses have been deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s not only the core that gets regular updates, but plugins and theme developers also publish latest versions of their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WP-CMS, themes, and plugins get better with every new release. Only the folks who work at Automattic INC know when WordPress update will be released. When a developer releases a newer version of his/her theme or plugin, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a notification for the same in the WP dashboard. The big problem with WordPress is that users will have to update their plugins, core files, and theme manually.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1000s of WordPress websites are hacked every day because the hackers are aware of the security loopholes in plugins and themes that the website is using. Usually, the websites that use outdated or nulled WordPress plugins and themes fall prey to hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are incidents where websites that use powerful WordPress security plugins are hacked. To keep your WordPress website or blog safe, you must back up the database and images on regular basis. You should also use a WordPress security plugin and tweak web server settings to minimize threats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is a Doctor of Science Degree?</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/what-is-a-doctor-of-science-degree/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I finally graduated after several years of intensive work from the University of Baltimore with a Doctor of Science degree in Information and Interaction Design. At the time I graduated people started asking me about my credential and whether or not it was the same as a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-doctor-of-science&#34;&gt;What is a Doctor of Science?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many articles online regarding this very topic. In some countries a Doctor of Science (often abbreviated as either Sc.D. or D.Sc.), is considered a different type of credential than what is considered in the United States. In the U.K. for example, an Sc.D. is considered a higher degree than the traditional Ph.D. This type of qualification there is only obtained by senior scholars in their field of study. In some cases it is bestowed as an honorary title.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Blog Commenting is the Worst Link Building Strategy?</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/why-blog-commenting-is-the-worst-link-building-strategy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Blog commenting is the worst strategy of link building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many pro bloggers recommend their followers to drop a comment on high page rank or high domain authority blogs (with similar niche). I think, this is the worst tip ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you seen the pro bloggers comment on other blogs which are more popular and have higher DA than their websites? The answer is no. Pro bloggers know that commenting on other sites will result in low-quality backlinks and their website&amp;rsquo;s traffic might be affected by this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Buying a premium WordPress theme ensures that you&amp;rsquo;ll be given assistance when you encounter problems with the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme will have clean code and it will be search engine and mobile friendly. Unfortunately, the premium theme which I used earlier on this blog was a waste of my money. I had bought it when I was a newbie blogger after reading a review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme was good initially, but the developer removed its inbuilt review system. When I asked the development team why they did so? They asked me to wait for a few weeks because they&amp;rsquo;ll be launching a review plugin. It has been 5 months now, the plugins have not been released yet. All my reviews and the schema start rating markups were gone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost every website visit you visit uses an analytics tool to track visitors and their activity. Only the organization that own its will have access to the tracking data. The company doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any reason to make their data public unless they&amp;rsquo;re generating advertising revenue from the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people using the internet are always curious to know how much traffic does their favorite website get. But as I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned earlier, the real data is with the site&amp;rsquo;s owner. Thus, no matter what tool you use, you cannot get the exact statistics of a website traffic unless the company decides to share it with the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TTFB aka first-byte time is nothing but the time taken by the first byte to reach the client machine when the client seeks a response from the server after the browser running on it makes an HTTP GET request. A small TTFB value indicates that your web server is fast. A high TTFB value denotes that your site is slow in responding to the browser&amp;rsquo;s HTTP GET request. To fix the problem, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to work on the code or check web server and DB configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pay per click advertisement platforms is the best way to monetize a blog. When it comes to the best PPC networks, nothing beats Google Adsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA is the most widely used PPC platform. It has 10 to 100 times better CPC rates than Chitika, InFolinks, Bidvertiser, etc. Thus, your first monetization option should always be Adsense. If your AdSense application gets disapproved, you should make your website better before resubmitting the application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a regular reader of this blog, you may have noticed that this site was throwing error establishing database connection or internal server errors last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue which was caused by the Linux out of memory manager has now been fixed, and the site is now live 24 x 7. I&amp;rsquo;m using this server to host some other WordPress websites as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing the error was a very confusing task for me. To be honest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about OOM process killer in Linux. If I knew how this module worked, the error would have been fixed on the day the error message appeared the system log file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since two weeks, my website was frequently crashing because the MySQL server stopped abruptly at random times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue started when I was on a holiday. My site was down for several hours. I configured crontab to start MySQL server when the service had stopped. This didn&amp;rsquo;t help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enabled query cache to reduce the load on the server. I use NGINX Fast CGI cache, APCu, and OpCache for my sites. Thus, I didn&amp;rsquo;t felt the need to install a caching plugin for my WordPress blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The image is one of the most important elements of a blog post. It not only makes the post attractive but also helps in improving the website&amp;rsquo;s search engine visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when you update a blog post, you may replace the image/pictures in it with some other pictures. Many users don&amp;rsquo;t bother to delete the old images from the uploads directory of wp-content WordPress installation folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a site grows larger, the uploads folder may have tons of unused images. These files waste storage memory, and they impact system&amp;rsquo;s performance. To delete or remove these files, download the Media Cleaner plugin and install it on your WordPress website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shared hosting plans are suitable for beginners and people with no knowledge of PHP, MySQL and Web servers. In a shared hosting, the company offers PhpMyAdmin, CPanel, Awstats (Google Analytics Alternative) and many more tools to make website configuration or deployment easier for a webmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared hosting comes with several limitations. Your site will be hosted with several other web portals, and it will have limited resource to use. Bandwidth usage will be a matter of concern. You are not allowed to experiment with PHP MySQL modules. Nor you can switch from Apache/Nginx to some other web server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Email marketing is probably incomplete without a good newsletter plugins that add subscription forms in our WordPress sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of free plugins to add newsletter forums to a website, but the features they offer are limited. For example, the MailChimp plugin doesn&amp;rsquo;t support popups, and it lacks an Ajax based form which makes the sign-up process fast. You can only change the background and button color with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The dreaded WordPress white screen of death means something has gone wrong and is preventing your website from loading. In most cases, the white screen of death will prevent both the front and back end from loading correctly and all you can see is a blank white screen in your web browser. The white screen of death is often caused by a faulty plugin or theme. In some cases, corrupt files, a database error, or a hosting issue could be the cause of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All my websites are hosted on an unmanaged VPS. The VPS has enough of RAM and a decent CPU. It can handle ten high traffic blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never faced any problems until last week when my website started displaying error establishing a database connection to the visitors instead of the content. This error was reported after I changed one of the table&amp;rsquo;s structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-the-heck-did-i-change-the-structure&#34;&gt;Why the heck did I change the structure?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I noticed Yarpp plugin displayed a message that I need to replace the table structure of my post content table from INNODB to MYISAM so that the plugin can display highly relevant related posts. So I changed the structure of my website&amp;rsquo;s DB table.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Blogging is the best way to express thoughts, share knowledge and reviews. Starting a blog is easy, but making money through it is difficult. Many people abandon/delete their websites or fail to succeed online because of the below blogging mistakes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-using-self-hosted-blogging-platform&#34;&gt;Not using self hosted blogging platform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self hosted platform is one which allows you to install a blog software of your choice on a shared, cloud or a VPS server. It gives you freedom to use any type of extension or plugin you wish to use. Self hosted sites are easy to set up. To do so, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to buy a hosting plan from a reputed company like Hostgator, Bluehost, Siteground, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WP login.php is the most critical page on a WordPress website. Without it, you will not be able to access the WP-admin area aka the WP dashboard and other users will not be able to register an account with your website.&lt;/p&gt;

To avoid this, you should secure the WordPress login page by:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress saves the post, settings and other data related to your website in an MSQL database. The DB is handled by the user through CMS with a DB management plugin or through a command line terminal from a remote computer (on unmanaged hosting environment).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before buying any product from a website or before contacting a business, search engine users will go through the reviews. If the reviews are negative, the user may not communicate with the business or he&amp;rsquo;ll leave the website without making any purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers are the best people to judge a product and the best way to get their feedback is by adding a review section to the website. Reviews may help in improving the rankings of a website as it may have many new keywords.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google PR is dead, and it will never be updated in the future. Advertisers have started using Moz rank and domain authority to know whether a website is ranking high in search engines or not. One more important factor they consider for checking the popularity of a website is the Alexa rank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domain authority and MR is generated by inbound link data of a website. Thus, a site with a good number of backlinks will have a good DA/MR. In one of our articles, we have mentioned that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t create inbound links manually. Make sure that you go through the article to know what happens when backlinks are created artificially.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The font is one of the most critical elements on a website. Developers make sure that the typography of their website is best in class. If your visitor finds that your site is ugly, he&amp;rsquo;ll leave it immediately without reading the content or making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 100s of fonts that you can use for free, but you will have to spend a lot of time in searching for them unless you use Google web fonts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The sidebar is one of the most critical section of a website. It not only helps in improving the revenue of a site by allowing users to place adverts above the fold but also helps in decreasing the bounce rate. On WordPress blogs, you&amp;rsquo;ll find banners, related/latest/popular post&amp;rsquo;s widget on the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content you add to the sidebar will be visible on all posts. If there are 1000 posts on your website, each and every advertisement or URL you&amp;rsquo;ll add as a widget will be displayed on each post. You may have grouped your posts in many categories. Suppose there are four categories on your website - phones, laptops, tablets, and desktop. Imagine you&amp;rsquo;ve published an article on a notebook.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you may not like your current WordPress theme, and you may think of replacing it with some other template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Themes allow you to export settings. But the settings you back up will be compatible only with the theme i.e. You can&amp;rsquo;t move settings of a Mythemshop template to TagDiv NewsPaper or Elegant Themes Divi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you change your template, you may have to tweak the design for the best experience of the user. You may also have to change image sizes so that the blog posts don&amp;rsquo;t look horrible or broken.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook allows the webmasters to add the Facebook comment form, like box or the page feed to their websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In WordPress CMS, adding a comment form or the like box is easy, but inserting a page feed is usually a tricky task for a webmaster. Even if the user manages to add FB feed to the sidebar, he won&amp;rsquo;t be able to customize it unless the user knows the working knowledge of CSS. In such cases, the user should use the free custom Facebook feed plugin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress supports taxonomies. In the WP CMS (content management system), the user can create as many tags and categories as they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A category is different from a tag. It is used to build a menu. If you create a treemap of WordPress structure, then the categories will always be the child of index or root page. They make navigation easier for the search bots and the visitors. On a small blog or a website, the webmaster should create only a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dual factor authentication has become one of the most important security features in the last few years. Major websites like Google Mail, Outlook, Facebook are now protecting user accounts in a better way by allowing them to use a mobile device as their identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To activate 2 step authentication, the service provider will ask you to install Google Authenticator app (or any of its alternative). Some websites will ask you to verify the mobile phone number so that the authentication service will send a 4 or 5 digit code when required. This code will be used for one-time verification, and it will be valid only for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On many established blogs, you&amp;rsquo;ll find related or recommended articles in post content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posts are embedded in a stylized &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; or &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; and they attract visitor&amp;rsquo;s attention. They&amp;rsquo;re known as inline related posts (IRP). IRPs, when placed at the right position can reduce the bounce rate of a blog. They can also increase the page-views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established websites have enough revenue to hire a WordPress developer who can write the code to insert content hyperlinks inline of the post automatically after the post has been published.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress is claimed to be one of the most secure content management systems of the decade, but you need to take some precautions while using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The login page is accessible to everyone using the Internet. To access the page, the user has to enter example.com/wp-login.php simply. If you&amp;rsquo;re using a weak password, then a software or a bot can easily hack your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some hackers will target your site with a DOS or DDOS attack. If your hosting provider has not set up a firewall for your account, your website and web server will be down. If the site has many visitors, you&amp;rsquo;ll lose some revenue. If the access to the wp-config file is not restricted, the hacker will get your database name and its password.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/advanced-ads-is-powerful-plugin-to-insert-and-manage-adverts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I felt the need to install a new third party plugin for inserting advertisements to my blog. My favorite plugin i.e. Quick Adsense has not been updated for over 1.5 years, and it has become unreliable because it has not been tested with latest WordPress versions. I searched the WordPress repository to find a reliable and frequently updated plugin for insert adverts. After a few minutes, I found Advanced ads. I was tempted to try out the plugin after going through its ratings and reviews shared by the real users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Creating a backup of the database is practiced in all the top organisations. For webmasters who work online, it&amp;rsquo;s the most important thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All websites are prone to hacking. Hackers are always in search of a security loophole in a website. When they find one, they&amp;rsquo;ll deface it by changing the index file. Hackers locate the site configuration file stored on the servers to find database password so that they can access the database.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/onepress-social-locker-plugin-for-wordpress-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content locker WordPress plugins are becoming popular these days. They are useful in increasing the Facebook likes Google plus one and twitter tweet counts. The plugin hides your content for visitors (not for search engines) and displays it only when the user shares your post on the pre-configured social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OnePress is the best content locker plugin for WordPress. It is available in free and premium versions. The free version of OnePress allows webmasters to add maximum three social sharing buttons, i.e., FB, G+, and tweet. The pro version supports many other popular social networks.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The default WordPress search module is useful, but not the best. No matter what keyword or term you search for, you&amp;rsquo;ll not be satisfied with the results generated by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This module is critical because people use it to find relevant information on your site. It can also reduce the bounce rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the WordPress content management system supports hierarchical pages (categories, tags, authors, attachment pages) that make navigation easy for the visitor, it is always a good decision to add a powerful search function to your blog. Thankfully, we don&amp;rsquo;t have to write PHP code for the same. There are a lot of free WordPress search plugins available for download. But the below two plugins are the best and most powerful among them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People disable comments from their website thinking that spammers or hackers will not target their sites. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s true that this form is always responsible for spam, but you should never think of removing it. Spam can be easily avoided with Akismet or its alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments are an important section of a website. Without it, your blog would look hostile and naked. No one would like to interact with you. Many people buy products from affiliate links only after reading comments. If you remove this form from your website, your conversion will be low. Moreover, the visitor will leave your site as soon as he finishes reading your post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Displaying popular posts in blog sidebar is useful in many ways. As your top articles are posted, the link juice aka page rank will transfer to them which in turn will help your posts rank higher in search engines like Google, Bing, etc. Adding a widget for the same is a good way of strengthening the internal link structure of your website. If your top posts have affiliate links, displaying them in the sidebar will boost your income and conversions. There are a lot of popular post widgets and plugins but the one which I&amp;rsquo;ve shared today is what you&amp;rsquo;re probably looking for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although W3TC has options to configure Memcache and OPCache modules, this plugin requires some configuration to work according to your expectations. It includes many features that you may not want to use.

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve purchased a VPS package from Hostgator, Bluehost or any other hosting provider, you should try out WP-FFPC. The highlighting feature of this plugin is that it supports various types of web servers and lacks complex features. You can easily run it on NGINX, LightHTTPD, Apache 2 platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The default WordPress commenting system is good, but some people may want to replace it with a third party plugin like Disqus, Livefyre for better control, spam protection, and administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disqus adds a lot of weight to your site, and you should think before using it. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen LiveFyre plugin on high traffic websites, and it looks great. I&amp;rsquo;ve not tested it. In case you&amp;rsquo;re searching for a Disqus or Livefyre alternative for your WordPress site, there&amp;rsquo;s a good new option available for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;ve installed a WordPress table plugin on your site. You have 1000 blog posts, and only 10 of them has a table. The Javascript and CSS files for the same will be inserted in the header section, and it will be called on all the pages even though you have not added a table. This increases the page size, and it can affect the page loading time. To solve this problem, you can either write a PHP code that will insert CSS and JS scripts in the site header only when required or you can install WordPress plugin organizer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When a lot of users are commenting on your articles, you should make sure that the comments do not affect the load time of the page. If it is affecting posts load time, the user should enable pagination for the same by navigating to Settings&amp;mdash;&amp;gt; discussions page or he must search for an alternative solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my tech blog&amp;rsquo; posts was having over 150 comments from visitors. The post is well written and has 1500 words in it. Due to a large number of comments, the visitor had to scroll down for more than 10 seconds to navigate to the footer section of my site. The footer is the important section for me because it has links to contact me, privacy policy, disclaimer pages, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SQL injection has been a method of attacking databases through multiple tiers of application infrastructure for many years, MacVittie (2008).  SQL or Sequential Query Language is a database language used to interact with large quantities of data, typically stored in tables inside a Relational Database Management System (DBMS).  Each command using the SQL language typically generates a result set of data.  An example of this follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;select * from accounts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The (*) is effectively used to return (all) columns of data in the ‘accounts’ table.  A similar, and more dangerous statement could be issued using the drop command:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shared hosting plans are relatively cheap as compared to VPS or dedicated hosting. This is because your site will be offered around 512MB RAM (or lower) and a CPU, which will be shared by many other websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites that are growing at a very fast rate should always be hosted on VPS servers (use dedicated if you require more RAM). If they&amp;rsquo;re hosted on Shared platform, their account might be suspended because of very high CPU usage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Databases like Oracle, MySql, PostgreSQL are designed to store data of the user securely. They&amp;rsquo;re fast and highly secure. Databases are the backbone of almost all types of web applications. Due to incorrect configuration or lack of maintenance, your site or application will slow down. In severe cases, it may also crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the major multinational companies, you&amp;rsquo;ll find DB Administrators who will take care of the data. The DBA guys work in shifts so that the firm&amp;rsquo;s applications are always running. If DB server is down, the revenue will be affected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a blogger, I&amp;rsquo;ve to use various strategies to earn money online. I use Google Adsense and many affiliate programs for the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about ads delivered by Google. The entire process is automated and handled to perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing affiliate links can be a headache because you&amp;rsquo;ve to be careful while using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you link them in your WordPress posts in such a way that Google can crawl them, your blog will be penalized. Matt Cutts (former webspam head at Google) had revealed that Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t like affiliate links. Thus you should make them nofollow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Usable Security? User Friendly Factors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In his article on usable security, Lampson (2009) asserts that usable security needs to begin with policy and how we model security systems within the organization. He makes the case that security has to be simple and at the same time it has to minimize hassle (for the end user). He concludes that the root cause of this problem is one of economics whereby we &amp;ldquo;don’t know the costs either of getting security or of not having it, so users quite rationally don’t care much about it. Therefore, vendors have no incentive to make security usable.&amp;rdquo; To get around this we must first look at simple models of security the user understands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of time can be spent in an organization firming up authentication and access control systems to ensure greater levels of security to their network. All of this however is only one step to insuring a users credentials are not compromised. Considerations need to be made for post authentication. There are several things organizations can do to mitigate risk associated with post login activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, training should be one of the top priorities of the organization. There must be a comprehensive training program for employees within different divisions of the organization (adjusted accordingly for the various levels of access and privileges).  In terms of proper use of access control technologies (such as tokens, etc.), policies, and best practices, “Organization members (need to) know what questions to ask and how to find the services they need” (Johnson, E. M., &amp;amp; Goetz, E, 2007). They need to be  aware that it is not acceptable, for example, to leave workstations unattended. Policies should be enforced ensuring that systems are locked down effectively when being left unattended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, my Google Analytics account has started showing a lot of referrer spam sites like SexyAli, free-social-buttons, Semalt, etc. The spammers are screwing up my GA reports. I have some websites. Tho site with 1000s of visitors is not affected but for my new portals, the referrers are causing high bounce rate which makes the report data confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some referrers seem to be attacking WordPress sites as the real-time reports show 30+ visitors (from spam sites) from various parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bloggers want a lot of features in their themes. They also expect their WordPress blogs and websites to load fast. Free templates have limited support and features. Thus, many of the bloggers buy a premium template. Before they make payment, the user will explore 100s of available options. This task induces a headache and creates a lot of confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is a job for professional and experienced bloggers like me to make newbies or WordPress users aware of the top themes. Last week, we published a detailed review of Newspaper template. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ve discussed one of the most popular and powerful WordPress theme named X. No other WP template is as perfect and user-friendly as X.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;English is one of the most widely accepted and spoken language around the globe. Whether its a TV or any other electronic device, English is used everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English has more than 2 billion speakers. Due to its importance, it has become an official language in many countries. Although it is used everywhere, let us face a truth that many people do not speak and write good English. There might be many reasons behind this problem, but one of the most common is the grammar. Grammar is vast and many people fail to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coupon websites can be very profitable if you bring traffic to it.

Coupon Raja was bought by one of the India&amp;rsquo;s largest media hours, i.e., Times Group. Before being purchased, it had reported over five crores of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such sites, you will find short posts with an affiliate link to eCommerce portal or any other service. This post includes rating, code, social sharing links, and a small description.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many website hosting providers offer better features and more free add-ons but if budget is not a problem for you, choose a product on the basis of its quality, not quantity. Frankly speaking, the best hosting companies in the world are Hostgator and Bluehost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hostgator is a superb platform for hosting websites, but if your site has been banned for high resource utilization or some other reasons, you should consider signing up with Bluehost as it offers similar features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Newspaper themes for WordPress are recommended for technology, travel, health, news, video and sports niche blogs. There are a lot of newspaper and magazine themes available for download in the wordpress.org directory. Most of them claim to be SEO friendly but unfortunately they&amp;rsquo;re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free themes have a major drawback that their support is limited. If you encounter any problems, you will have to post your query on WordPress.org forum. Most of the times, instead of the developers, other users will help you out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best WordPress sitemap plugins for better SEO (2018)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A sitemap is one of the most important elements of a website. It is nothing but an XML document that features all the pages and post of your blog. It should be defined in a correct way. Failing to do so will confuse search engines and the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When users start a new blog, they should immediately create a sitemap and submit it to Google and Bing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly Speaking, these two search engines are smart, and they can determine the structure of your site without a sitemap. But you should add this document to your site as it will be useful for the users (in case they&amp;rsquo;re  looking for it).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have seen fiverr gigs in which people try to sell 1000s of backlinks for just 5 dollars. These people will use an automated tool to build links to authority sites. If they don&amp;rsquo;t have a software, people will drop links in dofollow forums, or they&amp;rsquo;ll use the guest posting technique for the same. When I had started my career as a blogger, I read many blog posts that suggested newbies to build backlinks for getting traffic to my website. I followed this strategy for a while, and after Google algorithm penalized my blog, I had to delete more than 50 articles (with 500+ words) that were linked to dofollow blogs. Backlinks are now considered harmful. You should not buy backlinks or build them because of these two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people think that working from 9 to 5 is a nightmare. Some believe that working from home is a great experience. Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve been in both the situations and thus I can give a better explanation on this topic. I have spent a  year in an IT company. My working time was 9 to 6 or 7. After working for a year, I resigned from the job to be a self-dependent person. I can say that my decision was right as I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved my goal. I am earning decent money, and I am confident that my earnings will increase as the time passes by. Although I work from home and have a source of income, sometimes I feel frustrated because of disturbances from the surrounding. Here are the pros and cons of working from home online and working in a 9 to 5 job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google bot and other search spiders will visit the robots.txt file of your website immediately after they hit the htaccess file. Both these files are crucial as they can affect your site&amp;rsquo;s organic presence. Htaccess has rules to block IP addresses, redirect URLs, enable gzip compression, etc. The robots.txt will have a set of rules for the search engines. It has few lines that will either block or allow crawling of files and directories. Google has been penalizing blogs with thin content. If you&amp;rsquo;re a WordPress user, you should be aware of the taxonomies of the CMS. If you have generated many tags on your site, make sure that you make then no index as they&amp;rsquo;ll cause duplicate content issues on your blog. Don&amp;rsquo;t block them in the robots.txt file if you&amp;rsquo;ve enabled tags on single posts. If you don&amp;rsquo;t do this, page rank and link juice will be wasted. No index attribute for tags can be easily added via Yoast plugin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many self-proclaimed SEO experts believe that hiding WordPress date helps in improving search engine rankings. I supported their strategy until I started thinking more about user experience and rich snippets. If you&amp;rsquo;ve come across a post that claims to improve SERP position after removing dates from the blog, you&amp;rsquo;re being misled. Google knows when you&amp;rsquo;ve published a blog post through the sitemap file that has both published/modified dates. So you can&amp;rsquo;t fool it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every content management system has a login page, and dashboard that allows bloggers and webmasters to manage the data published on their site and WordPress is no exception. This page is relevant. Thus it will always be on the attack of website hackers that may/may not use automated program to gain access to your site&amp;rsquo;s dashboard. The default slug to log in to your WordPress dashboard is wp-login.php, and every hacker and WordPress user knows it knows it. Thus if you&amp;rsquo;re using the default password or if you&amp;rsquo;re using weak login credentials, your site might get easily hacked (You can remove the default user i.e., admin through the users page in WP).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;404 errors in WordPress is caused when a user or a search bot is not able to find a page on your site. This page might be linked from your blog post or another website. According to Google webmaster tools, these errors won&amp;rsquo;t affect your site&amp;rsquo;s performance in the search engine, but you should try to get rid of them for a better user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a lot of WordPress 404 errors can do more harm than any other factor. For example, the bounce rate will be very high as users didn&amp;rsquo;t find the page they wanted to access, they&amp;rsquo;ll hit the back button of the browser immediately without spending much time on your blog. Thus it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to get rid of 404 errors. You can use the below tips and plugins for the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Registering a domain name is one of the most important activities of a person who wants to make an online career. But managing it and setting up a hosting service can be tricky. Name of a domain should be chosen wisely on the basis of below criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: A DN should have one or 2 keywords that will kelp users understand what your blog/site is all about. The keywords should not contain the names of large enterprises (and their products). For example Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Windows, etc. If you ignore this, you&amp;rsquo;ll face legal action in the future. The company might register a DMCA complaint against your site which will force search engines to remove your blog from their index.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress is my favorite CMS as you can start any site with it.

To improve the performance and user experience, you should first consider improving the page load time. On WordPress site, you can easily do this by installing a caching plugin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have seen author bio widget below posts on many popular blogs. Bio section is important as it makes website users aware of the writer&amp;rsquo;s skills, hobbies, experience, etc. Just like about me, disclaimer, privacy policy pages, the bio section is one of the most useful elements of a WordPress site. Most WordPress themes include the author bio box and to display your information in it, navigate to your profile page by hovering your mouse cursor over users menu (This menu appears on the left side of your WordPress dashboard). If your theme lacks this widget, make sure that you install any of the below plugins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Backlinks from social networks like Facebook, Google plus, twitter, etc are nofollow. But you&amp;rsquo;ll be shocked to know that Google uses data from social networks to rank websites in the search engine regardless whether the link is dofollow or nofollow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone reads and article on your site and if he/she shares it in a group/page or on his public timeline, this link will be considered as a vote of trust. Thus, if your blog articles are shared 100s of time, there&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that your site will rank in the 1st 2 or 3 pages of Google. Making people share content is not a piece of cake. The user will not share your blog post unless he has a reason to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adsense program accepts websites that have quality content or very high organic search traffic. If your site doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any of these 2, instead of wasting your time in applying for Adsense account, use any of the below techniques to monetize your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve not recommended ad networks like Infolinks, Chitika, Vigilink, media.net as they pay you just one or 2 pennies for traffic from non-English speaking countries. These advertising networks demotivate bloggers due to their low payouts. Hence many bloggers quit their online careers within 5 or 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As WordPress content management system has a commenting and trackback system, it&amp;rsquo;s always on the target of spammers. Trackback links are added below the post content. A spammer who wants his website or YouTube videos to rank high in Google or Bing will drop useless comments with some URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re allowing dofollow backlinks, link juice will be transferred to the commentators website. To avoid this, install and activate the ultimate nofollow plugin on your blog. This plugin will allow you to convert all dofollow links in comments to nofollow. To block spam comments on your WordPress website, you install any of the below free plugins:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Immediately after the Google algorithm update, Bing updated its search algorithm to improve rankings of responsive and mobile friendly websites.

&lt;p&gt;For this class you will require three main applications, a text editor, an SSH client and an FTP client. A text editor will be used to write your HTML documents. SSH (Secure SHell) is a text based application which will enable you to setup your Nova web server account, which we will be using to host your web pages online. Finally an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client will be needed to actually copy over or upload your files to Nova from your PC or Mac. I am recommending your install Atom for text editing, FileZilla for FTP, and PuTTY SSH client for Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the user opens a search engine like google or bing? What is the 1st thing he sees? A large text box accompanied with a search button. To find information, the user must enter some data in the textbox. This data in SEO world is known as the keyword. Many bloggers, webmasters, and SEO professionals use keywords to rank their websites in search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the right keywords is not an easy task. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to spend plenty of hours using online tools like Google AdWords, sem rush, etc. Adwords is owned by Google. It is used by online marketing professionals and agencies to advertise products or websites in Google. The advertisers use AdWords to find keywords that a user enters in the search field of the Google. You can use this free tool only if you have a Google account.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>5 smart ways to reduce blog bounce rate</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/5-smart-ways-to-reduce-blog-bounce-rate/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/5-smart-ways-to-reduce-blog-bounce-rate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my perspective, bounce rate (BR) is one of the major search engine ranking signals for a blog. If it&amp;rsquo;s below 70, search engines like Bing, Google will love your site, and they&amp;rsquo;ll rank it higher than low-quality sites. If your site&amp;rsquo;s BR is high (above 90), it will rank low in search engines. If you&amp;rsquo;re an owner of such website, use the below strategies to reduce bounce rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-a-search-widget-in-sidebar&#34;&gt;Add a search widget in sidebar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not guys! The search bar is one of the most important elements on a blog. All top blogs in the world will have a search utility. When a visitor lands on your website and doesn&amp;rsquo;t find a relevant article, he/she will use the search utility to find a relevant article. If your blog navigation is not good, the search bar will come in rescue. If your site doesn&amp;rsquo;t have it, add a search bar immediately. You can create one for your blog with Google CSE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drupal can be installed on any number of environments, but since it was developed primarily to run on an Apache server with PHP and MySQL database, it makes sense to mimic this environment as much as possible in a development sandbox. There are LAMP applications for both Windows (WAMP / XAMP) and Mac OS (MAMP) which can serve as a Linux replacement, however recent innovations with Virtual Machines and Vagrant means that we can re-create a more native environment for development quickly and easily. Below I will describe how you can setup Drupal using some of these tools in less than 10 minutes. The Vagrant setup used here is Scotch Box. The objective is to setup a Drupal development environment with full LAMP stack capabilities including command line access and Drush integration using the native Linux file system for speed and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This article is broken down into three main parts, a brief intro, the main areas covered in the law, and concludes with the exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently migrated this site to Media Temple&amp;rsquo;s managed Wordpress hosting plan. For a number of years I had been running a dedicated server through CoreNetworks, which I have been extremely happy with. More recently however I have come to realize I no longer have the need for dedicated server and began researching cheaper managed hosting alternatives, which brought me to Media Temple. Over the years I have heard a lot of good things about this company so when I found out about their WordPress plans, I decided to make the plunge and migrate carnaghan.com to its new home. So far my experiences have been relatively positive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while now I have been using WAMP as my daily driver for Drupal development on my Windows 8 machine. For anyone who is a Drupal developer and uses WAMP (or a variation LAMP stack on Windows) has probably felt the pain it brings in terms of sluggishness, incompatibility with native Linux applications (Drush anyone?), and a headache administer PHP modules. I won’t even get into the problems I’ve had in the past getting cURL to work properly in Windows. I decided it was finally time for me to explore Vagrant as I had heard a lot about it but had never taken the time to do any amount of research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am often interested in hearing about how people within the software development community keep up with the latest changes in tools, technologies and programming languages. It seems that every few months there is a new framework or better way of doing something in an entirely new tool-set or language. For me personally, I don&amp;rsquo;t have much time during the day to spend reading the latest industry blogs and online development new outlets, so to help supplement this I routinely listen to a number of podcasts on my commute to and from the office.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How i increased blog traffic from search engines (Google &amp; Bing)</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/how-i-increased-blog-traffic-from-search-engines-google-bing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Blog&amp;rsquo;s income directly depends on the number of visitors your site gets from search engines. In AdSense terms and conditions, it is clearly stated that a user should avoid all fake methods of generating traffic. Affiliate marketing doesn&amp;rsquo;t have strict terms and conditions. My blog&amp;rsquo;s traffic was down several times but I never gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started with blogging, for the first 6 to 7 months, there were just 500 to 600 visitors/month to my site. When it was affected by a penalty, the traffic dropped to 100 or 200 visitors. These stats were not enough to generate a decent income nor was I eligible for AdSense program. Now the traffic has increased more than 10 times, 50 percent of my online income is from Adsense and the rest comes from four affiliate programs. Before the year 2016 ends, I expect my blog traffic to increase over 10000 UV/day. Here are the techniques I used to improve traffic to my blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to blogging and search engine optimization, no other on-page element is as important as title and meta descriptions. According to Google webmaster guidelines, every page on a WordPress blog must have unique meta description and title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t follow this guideline, your site won&amp;rsquo;t rank well in search engines, and if you&amp;rsquo;ve verified your blog with Google Webmaster tools, you&amp;rsquo;ll see duplicate tag warning in HTML improvements section of your GWT account. Meta description is one of the most important on-page elements as it is the first thing that a search engine users see (if your site appears in the search results) when they search for some information. If you&amp;rsquo;ve not added relevant keyword and a useful short information in this tag, the user will not visit your blog. Meta description length should not be less or more than 170 characters, and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be stuffed with keywords.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Slideshows are attractive, aren&amp;rsquo;t they? Blogs with slideshows have a very less bounce rate, high level of user engagement and better conversion rate. Many webmasters embed a picture slideshow in their sites. This makes users spend more time on the sites which in turn increases its search engine rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use an online tool to create slides, there&amp;rsquo;s no better tool than SlideShare. This tool can generate slideshow code. Thus, you can easily embed your slideshow on any blog/website. If you use this code, you will be wasting your page rank as the code will link your site to SlideShare without adding rel=&amp;ldquo;nofollow&amp;rdquo; attribute. The generated code will add an iframe to your site. Some search engines ignore the content in iframes. In such cases, you can use the best WordPress slideshow plugin, the Meta Slider. If you don&amp;rsquo;t use WordPress content management system, you can use a Jquery slideshow plugin. There are two main advantages of using the WP plugin:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to move my WordPress site from one server to another a couple of times with 0 seconds downtime and no loss of traffic. For a newbie, the transfer process can take almost an hour. For an experienced guy, the time will be reduced to 20 or 25 minutes. Migrating a WordPress site is impossible if you&amp;rsquo;re using a slow internet connection. So make sure that you&amp;rsquo;re a broadband user with a web speed of at least 1 or 2 MBPS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the 1st of April might have been the best day for you but it was an awful day for me. My top site, which generates a decent income was down for nearly 4 hours in the daytime. The site was not accessible to 100s of search engine users from 12:30 PM to 4:20 PM. The downtime was due to a network issue and misconfiguration by ASO staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network issue started around 12:30 PM and it was resolved after 45 minutes. The staff moved the affected domains to a new IP address but the mapping was not correct. So from 1:00 PM onwards, the homepage of my blog was being redirected to some shi*t site. This resulted in 100s of 404 errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reducing jpg, png file size on self-hosted WordPress blogs will not only improve its load time but it will also increase the search engine rankings of your post. Google considers site speed as a ranking factor. There are two ways to reduce picture size before uploading to your blog. Install a standalone Windows or Linux software that will resize images or use a WP plugin. The 2nd option is better than the 1st. Ever since I started blogging, I used the WP-SmushIt plugin for the same. Last night, after updating the WP-smushIt plugin, I saw a message that Yahoo would be stopping its free version of WP-smushIt service and to continue using the plugin, I have to upgrade to pro version. This made me search for a WP-smushIt alternative. After doing a bit of internet research, I ended up installing EWWW. Here&amp;rsquo;s my review for the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/best-keyword-density-checker-for-wordpress-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My technology blog was penalized at least 4 to 5 times. In my initial days of blogging career, I was not aware of terms like keyword density, on page SEO, backlinks, etc. I indulged myself in link building activities, and I was not focused on sharing top quality content. These three blogging mistakes killed my blog&amp;rsquo;s traffic up to 70 to 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they say, we learn from our mistakes and hard work pays off, I worked hard for 3 to 4 months to regain the lost traffic and rectified all errors that I committed. In those four months, I removed around 400 blog posts and improved the content quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google AdSense program can make you rich. But getting your blog or website approved for it is a challenging task. Newbie bloggers have to wait for several months before their sites get approved for Adsense ads. I had applied for 20 times. Each time I applied for Adsense, I got the rejection message stating that my blog is not eligible to participate in the program. The news was disheartening, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from submitting the application again. My site got approved on the 21st attempt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most discussed topics in SEO is backlink. Backlinks help a blog to get higher ranking in search engines. But they can be a reason for the death of your blog too. Backlinks can be created manually by the user or artificially via software. If you write a high-quality article which has unique content, your article will be referred to another website via a backlink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural links are useful, and you should avoid creating links using any other method. Google has explicitly mentioned in its webmaster guidelines that it will show no mercy on sites that participate in link exchanges, link trades, 5etc. Google&amp;rsquo;s Penguin algorithm has proven to be a sworn enemy of websites with bad link profiles. The Penguin algorithm is refreshed every 3 or 4 months. Tools such as Mozcast and algoroo can make you aware of any Google update. Today, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing the best five most powerful tools to check backlinks. These tools can generate a report on the daily, monthly or yearly basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Page load times of WordPress CMS powered blogs can decrease if webmasters start using a caching plugin. The two most widely used plugins for caching are W3TC and WordPress super cache. These 2 plugins create static HTML files from all of your blog posts and it saves these files to the cache folder on a disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress saves blog posts in database tables. When a search engine or a visitor requests it via permalink, WordPress loads the post from the database and it renders it as an HTML file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month, i decided to switch hosting from ******* to some other service. As there are many website hosting companies, i was confused to decide which one should I signup for. I was impressed with reviews on Hostgator, Inmotion, Bluehost and A2webhosting but I ended signing up for a small orange. ASO was suggested by some that folks have their blogs deployed on ASO servers. It has been a week since I moved my blog. I&amp;rsquo;m very satisfied with the performance of my new host.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Honeypots are sometimes used as an active defense mechanism for network security and provide a means for targeting attackers and recovering forensic evidence.  A typical honeypot traps attacks, records intrusion information about tools and activities of the hacking process, and prevents attacks outbound the compromised system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a need to test email functionality on an application within your local development setup?  I have found this process to be both time consuming and confusing in the past, especially when working within firewall restrictions.  Of course we can always test with real dummy email addresses, but what if we accidently send a mass email out to real users?  It is much better to test everything locally first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently Microsoft started offering a $100 per month credit to all MSDN subscribers for using their Azure cloud based services.  A lot of developers here at ICF have MSDN subscriptions so I definitely recommend checking this out if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already done so.  I never really considered using Azure for anything as I had assumed it was mostly used as a cloud based hosting service similar to Amazon.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I recently read a blog post by Scott Hanselman that I realized Azure could be used for much more than that. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Curriculum Mapping for Expeditionary Learning</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/curriculum-mapping-for-expeditionary-learning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Curriculum Mapping is the process of documenting lessons, activities and assessment methods used within different grade levels and classes in an educational institution.  Expeditionary Learning (EL) is a style of teaching that involves the students in experiences and problem-solving activities.  This paper explores the intersection of these two educational theories and addresses how pedagogical goals are met/not met by designing for both. It also addresses how the research of Heidi Hayes Jacobs (2004) affect efforts to design for and support this intersection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/backwards-design/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Backwards design is a methodology used to develop curriculum, which promotes the identification of learning results at the start of the design process.  Wiggins and McTighe defined this term as part of their Understanding by Design (UbD) framework.  Backwards design is not a new concept, it has been around for a long time and this paper explores some of the underlying research behind Wiggins and McTighe’s work.  Backwards design promotes a focus on teaching for understanding and learning, as well as designing the curriculum in way that meets learning goals while aligning results with state requirements.  (McTighe &amp;amp; Wiggins, 2012).  Often within education, learning goals are set first, before considering the assessment strategies that will be used to measure students’ understanding.  Without considering the results that are expected of a student, the chances of goals and assessment aligning with required results, or outputs are greatly diminished.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the 1980s the role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons saw the rise in popularity of model or figurine molds, which essentially allowed players to create character’s using casting kits.  These were in effect a very early day version of 3D printing, which has introduced the production of physical objects in the home.  3D printing has become more sophisticated in recent years and with that, the overall costs have decreased dramatically to the point where they are becoming widespread. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the ongoing discussions in the United States focuses on the need for regulation versus the need to free business from restrictive laws that would hinder innovation.  There are many sources that provide strong arguments for both sides.  You only have to look as far as the current state of patent regulations and recent lawsuits involving tech giants Samsung and Apple to see the impact these laws make within the industry. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Identity theft has been a growing concern over the last decade.  In recent years it has become a major problem for many as the Internet has taken over much of the day to day banking many traditionally did at their physical located branches.  Is there however a bigger concern with less knowledgeable and inexperienced Internet users, and are these users at a higher risk of becoming victims of identity theft? &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anonymity on the Internet provides an important layer of protection for people to express themselves online, while keeping their real life identity private.  It has led to both positive as well as negative implications over the years and there has been much discussion on the benefits and drawbacks on both sides. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Bidgoli, 2006) describes the statutory approach in the United States as being sectorial in nature “because the laws are drawn along industry lines.” This contrasts other parts of the world, such as the European Union, which has a non-sectorial approach where, for example a comprehensive privacy law applies to all organizations regardless of their industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years news stories have highlighted the increasing rate of cybercriminal activity targeting both private organizations and government entities. Cases from mischievous amateur hackers managing to exploit basic vulnerabilities, to more advanced security breaches carried out by expert criminal hackers and cybercrime organizations overseas, have grabbed the attention of the media.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hacking can be broken into several categories, including criminal hacking where the perpetrator is motivated by some tangible gain, usually monetary.  There are other forms of hacking which are driven by other factors such as political reasons. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/health-services-and-challenges-facing-the-low-literacy-population/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the United States, a large proportion of the population falls into the category of having low literacy skills.  “A long-awaited federal study finds that an estimated 32 million adults in the USA — about one in seven — are saddled with such low literacy skills that it would be tough for them to read anything more challenging than a children&amp;rsquo;s picture book or to understand a medication&amp;rsquo;s side effects listed on a pill bottle.” Toppo (2009).  This poses challenges for these individuals seeking services and assistance online using websites that have traditionally not catered for this segment of the population.  Services including health information for vaccinations, information on the availability of free clinics in the area, and advice and support from organizations such as Planned Parenthood, simply aren’t as easily accessible to this group of the general population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Computer applications are constantly evolving; while web based systems continue to grow in complexity.  It is essential that these systems are properly secured both at the server level as well as at the code or application level, therefore Information Systems audit standards, more specifically focused on application and development measures provide some of the most useful valuable information at an organizations disposal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that E-Government provides conveniences today that many take for granted, however there is an underlying cost for these services.  First of all, government sites are attractive targets for malicious activities, whether or not this involves deliberate disruption of service, or the stealing of sensitive information for profit. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During his 2013 State of the Union address, President Obama highlighted the importance of defending our nation from the many cyber threats that are continuing to dominate the news cycles. Just days prior to the President’s speech, eighteen people were charged in a massive credit card fraud ring. The Associated Press (2013) described it as a “sprawling international scam that duped credit-rating agencies” by using stolen identities of individual victims to steal $200 million.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bosworth et al (2009) stress the importance of formality that should be adopted when creating an ethics policy.  They emphasize that clear documentation, clear motivation, clear sanctions, and clear management support at every level, including the top, are all important pieces of an effective policy. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to SANS (2009) attacks against websites and web applications constitute more than 60% of total attacks observed on the internet.  The risk of attack is generally based on the probability that a threat of some kind will exploit a vulnerability or weakness in a system or network.  In recent years risks have been taken more seriously with many businesses that conduct online activities. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pfleeger (2005) reminds us that modern cyber-criminals can often be individuals that are difficult to detect.  They “wear business suits, have university degrees, and appear to be pillars of their communities.”  In addition to this, because of the wide spread accessibility to the internet and communications, it makes it easier for these criminals to operate in groups spread across the globe.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conditional statements (or decisions) and loops make up a good portion of programming code in general.  I am familiar with these concepts though other languages, however I have never programmed them in PHP.  This week I have been reviewing the first 5 chapters of Beginning PHP 5.3, which has been giving me a good solid introduction to PHP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Variables in PHP are similar to define and use as with other programming languages.  PHP uses loose typed variables, in other words they do not have to be defined specifically as a datatype upon initialization and can be changed to other data types using expressions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, the boom of the Internet has had a major impact on the way we interact with other individuals and business entities.  Products and services have become available at the touch of a button and access to vast amounts of information has become available to anyone with a direct connection to the web.  Much correspondence, which was traditionally mailed through the postal service now takes place online through e-mail communications.  Management of bank and other financial services accounts can all be administered through online tools where the customer seldom needs to enter a physical branch location anymore. &lt;br&gt;
There are clearly many advantages to this new connected world and services that are still evolving at the current time will provide even more convenience to users over the next number of years.   Unfortunately many of the conveniences of online services come at a price.  As software systems have become more advanced so too have the criminals who seek to breach these systems to their own end.   Computers have evolved to the point where the information stored now “contain wedding videos, scanned family photos, music libraries, movie collections, and financial and medical records.” (Vacca, 2009)  Vast amounts of information is being stored online in newer cloud based services which is creating even larger targets for cybercriminals.  Consumers have put their trust in many corporate organizations who handle their sensitive data to protect it adequately from those who would seek to steal or destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a hypothetical study, the Interaction Design and Information Architecture (IDIA) department at the University of Baltimore decided to promote their Humans Computers and Cognition (IDIA 640) course to prospective students already enrolled in the program and to those interested in the field.  In order to foster interest in the program, it was decided that a banner or ticker should be deployed within the department website, providing news updates and information about the program to interest visitors.  This paper documents the development of a ticker prototype intended to serve this purpose.  Discussion of the chosen content, rationale for design from a human centered computing and cognitive standpoint follows in the paper.  The prototype has been designed with an emphasis on addressing memory, forgetting, learning and mood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a Major News Website From a Human Cognitive Perspective</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/evaluation-of-a-major-news-website-from-a-human-cognitive-perspective/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, a shift has occurred in the way many people access, read and watch current events and news.  From the traditional newspapers and scheduled television news programs, we have moved to a more dynamic interactive medium, which dispenses information in a real-time format.  News websites are a fairly young media; however they have evolved exponentially since the late 1990s to the current time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article examines a popular news organization’s web presence and evaluates this resource in terms of human centered design and cognition.  It explores the website’s effectiveness of compiling and distributing news information in a way that is easy for humans to comprehend and process.  Much of the focus has been on the main homepage of the website; however other site pages have been taken into consideration adding context to some of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Security of Information Systems Infrastructure of an International Airport</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/security-of-information-systems-infrastructure-of-an-international-airport/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As information systems in airports continue to grow in both size and complexity, so too do the risks associated with security vulnerabilities and threats.  Since the terrorist attacks on September 2001, airport security has substantially increased in day to day operations to address modern threats that the transportation infrastructure faces.  Terrorist attacks however are only a portion of the security threats that an international airport faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced systems used in airports from customer ticketing and check-in, immigration and customs to air traffic control are all depended on daily to maintain operations involving vast numbers of customers travelling throughout the world.  These systems must be secured from a number of threats.  First and foremost, an international airport must be prepared for threats to its physical infrastructure including natural disasters as well as the danger of deliberate attacks.  Risks involved with untrustworthy employees or consultants should be appropriately mitigated through necessary systems permissions and auditing.  External threats of cyber attacks either through the airport’s website booking system or other vulnerable gaps within the information systems must be adequately addressed.  Operations within an airport that are vital to human safety must take a high priority with regards to security investment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The objective of this exercise was to use Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to identify improper configurations and missing security updates that could lead to vulnerabilities.  The system this was tested on is a dedicated server located at Core Networks (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.corenetworks.com&#34;&gt;http://www.corenetworks.com&lt;/a&gt;).  The server is used to host small business websites, from freelance web development work.  Up until recently a shared hosting plan was used at a company called Wiredtree, however the need for more server resources meant it was time to move to a dedicated server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those that may be unfamiliar with its meaning, the term blog comes from the combination of the words web and log. Blogs can typically consist of entries that include comments on culture, hobbies or everyday life, occasionally featuring a video or music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Security Concerns with Outsourcing IT Services</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing has become very common in recent years, especially in the field of Information Technology. So that companies can focus more on their core business, it makes sense to outsource many of their IT services and work to external organizations. In addition to this, quite often outsourcing can provide a cheaper means of labor if sent off shore, which enables the company to reduce costs and remain competitive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been developing in ColdFusion for a while locally using the built in web server. Recently at work several of the projects I am involved with moved to an IIS production server. In order to test fully in my local environment I needed to install IIS and setup ColdFusion to use it as the server instead of its built in version.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Many company web sites today have evolved from small collections of informational pages to a combination of massive database driven applications for sales, marketing, finance, extranets and customer relationship management systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back a few years ago I used to work full-time freelance web design. It&amp;rsquo;s a tiring job, and many people who can do it today earn a lot of money working for themselves in the trade. Web professionals are always in demand, but it&amp;rsquo;s difficult at times to find good web projects. Freshwebjobs.com changes all that with professional listings to pair up webmasters and developers to those looking into projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no doubt when it comes to social media and web video, YouTube takes the cake. Currently within top 5 Alexa rank and also owned by the #1 search engine and website online, YouTube has everything backing it. Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t control the monopoly though, there are so many cool video streaming services out there each with their own to offer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Design blogs have become the de-facto of the internet revolution over the past 2-3 years. As web design has shot off and every 16 year old and their mother has started to learn XHTML/CSS, blogging about it has just become another step in the process. DesignM.ag is one of the most popular, sharing free tutorials and graphics frequently in their posts. As of April 5 the site has been put up for auction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After visiting Reddit today, it was pretty obvious my favorite SubReddit circlejerk was up to no good. After toying around all week with a funny upvote arrow which looked similar to male genitalia, we&amp;rsquo;ve not seen an invasion of 4chan into Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With web URL shortening services in high demand these days, it&amp;rsquo;s no wonder adf.ly hadn&amp;rsquo;t come around sooner. Allowing you the same benefits of other free short URL services, adf.ly allows one big benefit - each pageview you get counts towards a small percentage of CPM costs for advertisers! Long story short, you get paid to use adf.ly&amp;rsquo;s services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent blog post entitled simply &amp;ldquo;Update from Jay&amp;rdquo;, it has been officially announced that Jay Adelson will be stepping down as Digg&amp;rsquo;s CEO after 5 prosperous and amazing years. Jay has done an amazing job as CEO, and I firmly believe Digg wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hold it&amp;rsquo;s current success status today if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for his ideas and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There are many other choices, but DP will always hold a special place in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of running the same design, DP has finally upgraded to a fresh web 2.0 look and feel to the entire site! Now running what is clearly the latest version of vBulletin 4.0 Forum Software, the latest design really kicks new life into such an expansive and helpful community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Although still just breaking off the ground, Thuhm has a lot to offer it&amp;rsquo;s readers. Recently there had been a post mentioning new updates on the site, including a new front page design and the addition of categories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PSD Conversion is a very high-paying business. Many amazing designers know how to work through Photoshop but just don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or haven&amp;rsquo;t learned how to code their designs into XHTML and CSS code. This is where many popular companies come in to help, the most popular being psd2html.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For all of you running a design blog out there, DesignMoo is a site you&amp;rsquo;re going to want to bookmark. As I&amp;rsquo;m sure we all know of Digg&amp;rsquo;s popularity, this has caused many smaller sites to spawn offspring and grow into micro-niche Digg sites. DesignMoo is one of these style of sites for graphic and web design, and can bring in a lot of traffic to your blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mashable is one huge blog, a very large competitor to Inside the Webb and what I wish we could be someday! They run some amazing articles about social networking, social media, tech news, and everything internet related. They usually have articles hitting the front page of Digg and Delicious, gaining well into 1500+ ReTweets and tons of Stumbles: bottom line, their blog is huge!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mostly all internet marketers are aware of what Google&amp;rsquo;s PageRank is. Ranking pages on a scale of 0-10 based on the amount of backlinks, and the quality of those links. Compete works in a very similar way to Alexa, where it ranks different site&amp;rsquo;s positions in the grand scheme of thinks. Now with Alexa Ranking the lower the better, and the same goes for Compete Ranking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Many micro-niche sites have popped up running on Pligg&amp;rsquo;s backend, and CypherBox is my latest find.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting around December I had seen a lot of blogs posting about Yahoo! considering closing the doors on MyBlogLog. I was sad to hear this news, as I have been a huge fan of MyBlogLog since it first launched in 2005. It was a simple community of bloggers with a simple goal of uniting the best writers and bloggers on the web.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember a time when Digg used to roam wild in the Social News kingdom. It was the force to be reckoned with when it came to internet marketing - everybody needed to hit the front page to gain some traffic to their site. I&amp;rsquo;m sure tons of blogs have built their popularity off of Digg&amp;rsquo;s massive traffic influx, but there are many signs pointing towards this site closing the lid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly one of the most important aspects of running a blog is keeping up with design trends. You can write amazing articles and share the best tips on the web, but if your blog looks like a run-down 1990&amp;rsquo;s ripoff or some generic Wordpress template, chances are you won&amp;rsquo;t be attracting many visitors to your site. The most famous and successful bloggers realize how important a custom design really is, and no expenses are cut when it comes to design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of us enjoy sticking with our usernames. We sign up with the same username on multiple websites, and this is especially true with social networking/bookmarking sites as it allows your name to become a presence in the community. Only thing is, there&amp;rsquo;s so many people online that the chances of our username being take is, well, pretty decent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the fastest growing professions is website design and web developers, especially with the attraction of working freelance. Many people hate the 9-5 grind induced through corporate America, and having the option to work from home on your own time seems like a much more viable and interesting option to many. Although in the end it may require a bit more work on your end, the ultimate freedom of your time seems to pay for itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am extremely fond of the new social news script Pligg CMS. I have been following it since early release, and updating Pligg sites used to be very difficult. However from instructions from this wiki, you can use TortoiseSVN to control the version and upgrades of your Pligg site with ease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know I know, I&amp;rsquo;m a guy and the word &amp;ldquo;cute&amp;rdquo; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in my vocabulary. Well if I ever needed to use the word cute to describe anything, it would have to be moourl.com. It&amp;rsquo;s a URL shortening service with an actually &lt;em&gt;bearable&lt;/em&gt; design to it. Beautiful vectors and color scheme, I love the site!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a web designer myself, I have found that other web designers I talk to always have favorite websites they go to for inspiration. Not saying they want to copy a specific website, but there are just some site&amp;rsquo;s that &amp;ldquo;stick&amp;rdquo; and really inspire you to create web designs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New URL Shortening services hit the web every week it seems. I can remember not too long ago when TinyURL was just starting up, and that hit with a huge bang. Ever since then, there have been countless creations of URL shorteners (where some even provided stats). However, only a select few have really succeeded to hit mainstream popularity and be of any use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finding a decent web hosting company today is difficult. So many companies overprice, can&amp;rsquo;t keep uptime promises, have horrible support, or offer you barely any space to store your site&amp;rsquo;s files and content. The few that have shown promise in the past are some of my favorites: Hostgator, Dreamhost, Bluehost, etc. However as I was browsing the web one night (like always) I ran into a great looking hosting company, This*.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;limitations-and-opportunities-explored&#34;&gt;Limitations and opportunities explored&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile devices have many positive aspects including opening up networking channels and increasing the accessibility of information, but as with any new technology, potential pitfalls must be researched, remedied and cautiously provided for.  This literature review discusses several potential pitfalls of mobile technologies as well as potential opportunities faced by developers of software as well as mobile device manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, several themes are highlighted through existing literature on areas concerned with the development of mobile applications.  These themes include context awareness, mobile security, usability and accessibility.  By focusing on these themes and researching the literature available, the developer will be better equipped to face the challenges and opportunities ahead in order to create practical and usable applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Omegle.com has spread across many social networking hubs, forums, and internet chatrooms rapidly over the past few months. It&amp;rsquo;s a new site with a very simple concept: you log in anonymously and talk to someone else. Someone random, someone you&amp;rsquo;ve *probably* never even met before, just talking about whatever. It seems like a breeding ground for spam and pranks, but it ultimately seen very positive results in traffic and user response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Digging through the internet for your favorite ROM can be a frustrating process. Some sites can&amp;rsquo;t be trusted, others just throw you around in loops to find exactly what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. I have recently gotten a short, sweet, and to the point interview with the founder of CoolRom.com Edward Chang. In it, he discusses revenue streams from the site, traffic stats, and how he built and created a Emulation and ROM empire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Finding the right application, storage space, or transporation method for files used to be very difficult only 5 years ago. Now with file upload sites and forums/bulletin boards to share files, sending your friend a song or posting up a funny picture has never been easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m at a design roadblock I usually turn to typical web design blogs to get the juices flowing again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Therefore, a new competitor has stepped up to the plate: DesignBump.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Article bookmarking and submission sites have become a commodity on the web today. There have been only a few veterans that have been around long before it was &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; to have a site in the social news niche, and Drew Curtis&amp;rsquo; Fark.com is one of them. Fark is social news with a twist: comedy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The simple application allowing everyone in the world to share what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, thinking, or feeling in 140 characters has grown into one of the most popular web 2.0 applications on the web, and it&amp;rsquo;s no doubt there are many apps on the web to accompany it. Although not affiliate with Twitter in any way, twtapps is a neat website that features some of the coolest web 2.0 applications that help businesses market on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sonic and the Black Knight - Wii Preview</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/sonic-and-the-black-knight-wii-preview/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before, Sonic was running really fast and he jumped on his enemies to get rid of them. It was the good old days you would say the nostalgia of his adventures on the Megadrive. Today, his platform of choice is the Nintendo Wii and its controls to the Wiimote air. A search from noon to fourteen hours, if the blue hedgehog explores the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, it is only a pretext for a gigantic sword that it leads to Using the remote control. For the rest, the gameplay of the previous component is included, since it always leads Sonic in a sort of corridor using the Nunchuk. The game is in 3D, and rather pretty, but when we want to go back, the hedgehog is the moonwalk idling. As in Secret Rings, it is impossible to turn back. We regret a bit of Sonic Adventure for the Dreamcast console. Even if we admit that this game forces us to move forward by taking advantage of the speed of this oh so endearing character.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The House of the Dead: Overkill - Wii Preview</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Dead House has risen the degumming of zombies to the rank of an art. After a through enough portage in episodes 2 and 3, the Wii will finally host an original and jubilant forthcoming opus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Overkill.3&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.carnaghan.com/the-house-of-the-dead-overkill-wii-preview/images/Overkill.3-300x205.jpg&#34;&gt;At the outset, the fans can rest assured, the unique atmosphere of The House of the Dead has been preserved. Bad taste, humor at twenty cents, torrents of hemoglobin, the Sega team has worked hard to restore the atmosphere of horror cinema of the 60s. The image is deliberately patina, the soundtrack evokes the films &amp;ldquo;Pulp&amp;rdquo; dear to the heart of Tarantino and just take a look under the letter written in levels of blood (“Papa&amp;rsquo;s Palace of Pain,&amp;quot; &amp;ldquo;Scream Train&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;) to understand that the script never takes itself too seriously. Chronologically situated before the original episode, it is far from devoid the interest since we propose to follow the beginning of the famous Agent G and his sidekick, Issac Washington. The opportunity to try to learn more about one of the most enigmatic characters in the series.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ClosR.it is another great web 2.0 application I stumbled upon while browsing the net. It allows photo enthusiasts, designers, professional photographers, and really anyone who takes pictures to upload their photos in high-resolution. The problem with many other image hosting services is that they cap limits on the site of the photos, or just re-size them. ClosR.it allows full HD image views, perfect to share with all of your photo-enthusiastic friends and family!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a flash on Xbox 360, Tenchu arrives at as a wolf on Wii. Scheduled for March 5th, Tenchu Shadow Assassins has the honor of a preview after what it achieved at the last Tokyo Game Show. The result seems always so convincing? This is the question that the following attempt to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Tenchu.3&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.carnaghan.com/tenchu-shadow-assassins/images/Tenchu.3-300x170.jpg&#34;&gt;The first strong point of the game is to return to a more classical style than Tenchu Z which included creating your own ninja. A point of creation but the possibility to find the cheap Rikimaru and Ayame adorable. Originality, it is very nice because we don’t face a narrative echoing like those of the other episodes but on the contrary, the pleasure of the reunion is indeed real. In addition, it helps to consolidate a mythology implementation that is over 10 years old. It will therefore not be surprised to find Lord Goda, for who the knights of the shadow work, or the princess Kiku who don’t find anything better than to be kidnapped early in the game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remained in the shadow of Resident Evil (with whom it has little in common) and Silent Hill, Project Zero is still a safe bet in survival-horror. Better still, it is complementary to the two sets mentioned above in its construction based on the constant effects of surprise to even make you jump like a frightened virgin. Mask of the Lunar Eclipse is of course no exception to the rule and do not forget to maintain multiple links screenplay with his elders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first Rock Band has hit the headlines, it&amp;rsquo;s the least we can say. We know you suffered and the video game world has a scale of change of its own. As required, the most obvious change in this new version is aesthetic. Guitars, always drawn by the contours of a Fender, have inherited a sunburst finish that will clear copper brown in the center burned on the edges. There is also an effort at the handle to give it a wood effect. On a more technical note the arrival of a tiny camera and microphone to facilitate synchronization with the scores scrolling on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>One Piece Unlimited Cruise: Episode 1 - Wii Preview</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Echoing the broad outline of the pattern established in One Piece Unlimited Adventure, the Unlimited Cruise series certainly does more of the element of surprise but it should nevertheless allow us to follow for a long time wandering the straw hat and his band of pirates off standards. Before entering the heart of the matter, it is better to warn immediately the reader: One Piece Unlimited Cruise: Episode 1 is based on narrative elements that we discovered that from Volume 46 of a manga. Thus, although the scenario of the game does not follow the pattern of the series, there are characters and elements that may not have the players not yet reached this stage of history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may know MySims is a simulation game on Wii. But over the management of family, you can head a Sims and invests in a real mission, if not a destiny: to revive a virtually abandoned city. The next MySims almost deserves to be renamed OurSims. Indeed, MySims Party is a license that offers a real multiplayer aspiration and explores new ways to play video games. However, it forgets nothing that made its success, starting with its so special graphics style and its total originality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought that the family friendly Wii console from Nintendo would host a game for sweet crazy days as steam as MadWorld? Make no mistake about it, with its black and white graphic with only the red color of blood, MadWorld is a work of unprecedented violence and barbarism without a name. But while Manhunt disturbed by realistic context similar to our daily and conventional weapons, MadWorld plays the cards of immoderation outrageously. Chainsaw, sharp barbs, shredded body, nothing will be spared. Disturbing? Strangely no, not at all. Once the Wii controller in hand, we forget the immoral side of the title to focus on our goal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While scorpions and tarantulas are generally slaughtered by the heroes of most RPG and all other beat&amp;rsquo;em, Deadly Creatures offers us the opportunity to become one of those horrible creatures today and to explore the labyrinths infested with vermin. Brrrr!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Deadly.3&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.carnaghan.com/deadly-creatures-wii-preview/images/Deadly.3-300x239.jpg&#34;&gt;Pertussis of casual players, Wii hosts traditionally family games party, brain coaches or public platforms games. Who would have thought therefore that developers of Deadly Creatures can choose this as a console exclusive title, it is disturbing? For once, in fact, it is not about caring for a shetland or save a princess in nice flower but to confront our fears of the most stubborn child diving head first into an universe populated by snakes, spiders and other forms of repulsive life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More than two years after investing the screens of Xbox 360 owners, the zombies of Dead Rising take the nice little Wii. If the game keeps the fun of his style, why ignore this new version?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Dead Rising.3&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.carnaghan.com/dead-rising-chop-till-you-drop-wii-preview/images/Dead-Rising.3-300x225.jpg&#34;&gt;Before diving further into the stinking bowels of the beast, take a few seconds to remember the context of the adventure, an identical course than the version 360 of course. The player embody Frank West, a nosy reporter, which aspires to get the scoop of the century. The shape of a boxer, a trucker Belarusian faces, replicas of the dead and a furious motivation, this is what you can expect when you see the guy. After a short trip by helicopter over a curiously American town in quarantine by the U.S. Army, Frank will finally end up trapped in a mall, a sort of giant shopping center particularly appreciated in this country. Unfortunately, this consumption temple, once so peaceful, is now infested with corpses and survivors traveling more or less helpless. Because, if the majority of them do ask to be rescued, the others seem almost more dangerous than zombies because of their fear, their folly, their unconscious motivations or their secrets. But on this particular subject, we will voluntarily silent because we don’t want to spoil the surprise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Konami let itself be drawn into the tendency to cross-over with Castlevania Judgment which marks the encounter of the most charismatic characters in the series. A radically different way from what Koji Igarashi used us since it is neither more nor less than a 100 % fighting game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Castlevania.3&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.carnaghan.com/castlevania-judgement-wii-preview/images/Castlevania.3-300x171.jpg&#34;&gt;Within two decades, the Konami gothic saga took the time to make a name with players in a sprawling building on a large number of different media. Today, the series extends primarily on consoles, waiting to know what will happen in the next major opus announced on PS3 and Xbox 360. As with SoulCalibur Legends, the Wii will finally be entitled to an episode of this prestigious marginal saga, the one this is the subject of this overview. Designed for the most unconditional fans, Castlevania Judgment certainly does not have the aura that characterizes the other parts of the series, but it is still a good opportunity to unwind alongside the cult figures of the saga&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Pownce first launched in the summer of 2007, I thought it would revolutionize how I communicated and shared stuff with my friends! By the way Kevin Rose had hyped it, you could share any type of file (music, video, .zip archive), share notes, share photos, really anything you wanted to with your friends! This was an application that was desperately needed on the web, and to this day I still claim there needs to be something to fill the void.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This unparalleled quest, you will be able to live in two different ways, depending on whether you opt for the Wii or the GameCube version. If their content is identical, the gaming experiences they provide vary widely, given the considerable changes made to gameplay by the Wii version, and it goes without saying that it necessarily benefits of an additional attraction in terms of discovery. Nevertheless it was legitimate to have some reservations and doubts about the effectiveness of its grip bold and unprecedented for a title of this magnitude. But to be among the first to have questioned the relevance of the outcome, let me dispel any fears you may have about this. Not only is the unique gameplay on the Wii version significantly renews the feeling of the game, but it is also intuitive enough to be forgotten in a few hours, the difficulties of taking control that inevitably occur when the familiar first time with a console of a new kind. Thus, cross swords through the Wiimote is going to become second nature, like each of the actions you&amp;rsquo;ll be asked to and you will see how fun that can be feel when engaged in a video game depends on the immersion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was discovered in 1999 on N64, and nearly ten years, the series will count as three episodes, each on different mediums. But when we see how it has evolved in that time, we see that Nintendo has made the right choice by focusing on quality over quantity. Super Smash Bros. Brawl succeeds an episode GameCube already very convincing and dethrones without difficulty. Just start the software, the player is literally bombarded by an avalanche of game modes, new to most, and can only kneel before the proper amazing range of characters available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently been scoping out some cool web 2.0 sites to add to my blog for my first interview, and I found my answer lying in the new startup task.fm. This app has only been online for about a week so far, but already has a booming userbase of 1000 regular users and growing daily. Task.fm allows its users to have reminders sent through e-mail, phone, and SMS. The reminders can be entered by the user, and typed in regular speech, too! Below is my interview with the site&amp;rsquo;s creator Anthony Feint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Super Paper Mario - Wii Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Super Paper Mario retains a focus on running the adventure, but separated from its background on the role play, starting with the fighting in turn-based. A change that should delight all those for whom the name of Mario is totally separated from the platforms type, which at least has the merit of renewing a few things. It is hoped however that Nintendo has not drawn a line on the concept of the Mario RPG, but it is likely that the next title will be rather light on DS. Nevertheless, Super Paper Mario is not just a platform game, it is above all a constant source of amazement as it demonstrated creativity in both its playful design and design graph. The result is very refreshing and proves that the field of video game is full of hidden concepts waiting to finally be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since its announcement, Super Mario Galaxy generates almost more confusion than curiosity in the hearts of players. The system evolution at the heart of this might he not have to change, or worse, distorting the very spirit of the series and the formula for Super Mario 64? Legitimate concerns, but in vain, since the idea to move Mario in a galaxy appears to be the key that opens the very doors of renewal and that allows him to leave behind him all his previous adventures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Begin by the end if you want: a direct reply to the question of terminating the preamble to this test. So if Resident Evil 4 is still an excellent title on Wii, there is nothing new to his colleagues if not at the game console to own. Out of this, so it will still be entitled to the entire positive that this adjustment has the additions of the PS2 and PC versions starting with a game mode missing from the GameCube version: Separate Ways. The latter, like the assignment mode, you will lead the beautiful Ada throughout five missions. From the pure value added, especially the way that we proposed to visit a new decor and new looking kinematics. But before discussing this in detail, let us look at the original script.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Prince of Persia Rival Swords - Wii Review</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/prince-of-persia-rival-swords-wii-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Too often adored and envied for their destiny out of the men elevated to hero often lead a life similar to that of the martyrs. Exhausted by years of wandering and fighting, he could push past his fight against the Dahaka and the curse of the sands of time, the Prince of Persia was an illusion to believe that he would finally know peace. But fate hounds brave men, and most recently, the tired hero takes up arms to face his worst enemy: himself. The scenario of evil Prince of Persia: Rival Swords is one of those who make you want to make a novel. All players who have overcome the hardships of the first two components together with the Prince know that we cannot forever endure such tortures without paying the price. Returned to Babylon with Kaileena, the Empress troubling time, the prince, nobody knows the name, discovers a city ravaged by war, a kingdom invaded by rivals more cruel than those which it has dealt so far. Therefore, the story starts quickly, leaving not even the soul time to break under the harsh fate that has befallen him. Victim of a conspiracy organized by a manipulative and tyrannical Vizier, Kaileena is killed in front of his eyes. Prince powerless to release the sands of time, even letting himself be contaminated by those who make the chew from the inside, corrupting his soul to bring out the evil that is in him and materialize in the form of sadistic entity: the Dark Prince. From a quality equivalent to the Two Kingdoms on GameCube, the achievement is as compelling and captivating. The opposition between the high and low quoted cities renews perfectly sets and the atmosphere that emanates from, and the animations are still among the very best at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the pointer of my blog editor flashes before my eyes, I suddenly feel some anxiety, some fear. The latter told me that I could not find the right words to describe what I was invaded by discovering Okami. Thus, paradoxical as it may seem, the doubt comes knocking at my door just as many blank pages await my impressions I sleep to tell you my journey, the same one that made me assume the role a Japanese divinity which has been a difficult task to restore color to a world fallen into a torpor monochromatic. The exercise is all the more difficult it is a kind of homage to a still-born point that deserved its deadly fate. But this is not the time for tears, if not joy, because constrained and forced, I am ready to really start this test and tell you about one of my best gaming events since I looked on my very first Game &amp;amp; Watch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, the best part of Guitar Hero has been developed by Harmonix. Because it ends the suspense, Guitar Hero 3 supplants its elders, admittedly few, but still. It must be said that the formula has not changed, not to say that it remains unchanged with the exception of a few discrete improvements and additions not necessarily essential. The first change in size provided by this third edition is obviously the partial abandonment of lumpish from the previous flap. Activision puts his hand to the portfolio as well to recall how the popularity of Guitar Hero actually an advertising and therefore unavoidable, we are left with almost half of the tracklist that consists of original songs, singer without risking a dangerous original interpreter imitation of the solo and without deviating a bit from our memories. The disadvantage is that by contrast, these times always seem to do most unfortunate that, inevitably. Composed, therefore, with security whose integrity has been little affected, the new playlist of the game is a pure marvel, perfectly balanced between musical styles and technical approaches. Rock, Alternative, Metal, Blues-Rock, the sounds of electric fan is not only spoiled by the variety of styles but also by the worthy representatives selected by and paid by Neversoft Activision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We don’t have to introduce you Steven Spielberg, the great director who marked his entire generation of cult films such as Jaws, ET, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Jurassik Park, Indiana Jones or The Saving Private Ryan. In the last 25 years, this genius of the cinema has become one of the greatest filmmakers of all time and has amassed a colossal fortune that he invested to produce new films and support educational organizations. Not happy enough with having conquered Hollywood, Spielberg is tackling now the gaming arena with the prestigious publisher Electronic Arts. So that logically could be expected in a project supported by a more than great realization, the concept of Boom Blox is very basic. And the most surprising is that it works wonderfully!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Do We Need Financial Regulation?</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/why-do-we-need-financial-regulation/</link>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/why-do-we-need-financial-regulation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;[1]  “The purpose of financial regulation is to improve upon the performance of financial markets relative to how they would perform driven solely by the forces of the private marketplace.” Banking is one of the most highly regulated industries within the United States.  We can understand the impact of regulation by taking a look at the history and evolution of the banking system through to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-early-banking-system&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Early Banking System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the early days of banking, the industry has faced many changes in regulation due to different needs arising throughout the years.  In the early days, government control was not favored among most of the original settlers who had come from countries where too much federal control was exerted.  Therefore the early banking system comprised of a multitude of different small banks printing their own currency, which would often fail and leave customers with lost funds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Electronic financial transactions have become a common part of everyday life with enhancements in technology and a gradual acceptance and trust of these new ways of doing business.  As the world continues to grow smaller through communication and other technologies, demands have increased dramatically for methods of providing instant financial services.  This has become especially true for people traveling globally with a need to access their finances in different currencies.  Both credit and debit card transactions provide a convenient 24 hour per day access to funds on demand, while other technologies are available for wiring money and sending electronic funds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More and more companies within the US are hiring foreign personnel on work visas.  As a result, it is vital that any organization wishing to hire a person from a different country must fully understand the laws behind the process of sponsoring an alien to work for their business.  Obtaining work visas can be complicated and, more importantly, time-consuming processes. It is therefore vital that business objectives be clearly established and that visa planning occurs as early as possible to ensure a smooth process of employment.  There are many ways that foreign citizens can apply for residence to the United States; however, the focus of this research paper is on obtaining a work visa through organizational sponsorship and does not outline immigration-visas or ‘green cards’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Internet was the result of some visionary people in the early 1960s who saw great potential value in allowing computers to share information on research and development in scientific and military fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howe, W (1998) A Brief History of the Internet&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www0.delphi.com/navnet/faq/history.html&#34;&gt;http://www0.delphi.com/navnet/faq/history.html&lt;/a&gt; (January 28th, 2000)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;history-of-the-internet&#34;&gt;History of the Internet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet has had a relatively brief but also explosive history over the last few decades. It originated from an experiment, started by the U.S. Department of Defence during the 1960s. The Department of Defence wanted to create a computer network that would continue to function in the event of a disaster, such as a nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Internet has grown beyond a simple tool for a small number of education and government agencies over the last few years. The commercialization of the Internet has opened a brand new market for small, medium and large commercial bodies to provide access to this huge network of opportunity for business and home users alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These companies are the sole providers of access to the ‘Information Super-Highway’ and it is therefore important to analyse how they have managed to survive in the past as well as their current and future success. The basis of this dissertation has concentrated mainly on the small to medium sized ISP providing services to the local business community and tends to concentrate on the issues involved here. It is important to look into periods of the past few years and how ISPs have developed into the providers that are common on the market place today. Through analysing the changes that ISPs have faced in the past, this will give a better gauge as to where the ISP needs to look to for future opportunities and more importantly, future survival.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned within the last chapter, Internet Service Providers have been forced and are currently being driven away from the traditional subscription access only service. Nowadays, many ISPs have started to offer free access to the Internet in order to drive customers to their services. The first of this kind of service within the United Kingdom was Freeserve. They originally had the backing of the Currys group to market their free Tier 3 ISP to the general public, which proved to be extremely successful. After the launch of Freeserve, many other Internet Service Providers began to offer free access through a dial-up service in order to compete within the market.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been surprising to see the amount of small Internet based companies that have ‘made it big’ within a very short period of time. Perhaps it has been the pure innovation of releasing a particular service on-line or offering goods that no one else had yet thought of. Perhaps it has just been a case of the company getting in before others had giving them the edge that would continue for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Internet has become a vast marketplace for global goods and services. For e-commerce to prosper, you have to feel safe about transmitting credit card and other financial information over the Internet. Because information traveling over the network actually passes through many computers along the way, the opportunity exists for someone to steal confidential information. Hackers also break into computers to steal data. No one really knows how often this actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Service Providers (ISP) frequently have to face the question as to how they can protect their existing business and, at the same time, remain profitable in the future. For, on the one hand, the strong concentration process drastically shrinks the margins of pure access providing. New competitors, for example the major telecommunications companies, are flooding the market with ever cheaper offers. Prices continue to fall. And customers, who are becoming more and more &amp;ldquo;literate&amp;rdquo;, are now designing their own HTML pages. To quote a study issued by the European Union (EG DGXIII.A3) ISPs will not survive in the long term if they do not provide add-on services such as consulting or electronic publishing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Computers play a vital role in the commercial world today as I.T. advancements mean newer tools and facilities available in all industries.  However without the means of communications between workstations within a computer network, the distribution of information would not be as straightforward as it has now become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at how this type of communication is possible, it is necessary to examine the physical hardware and software processes involved.  A multi-drop link is quite simply a very basic communication device that enables multiple Personal Computers to interconnect with each other.  This is made possible through a special chip found inside all Intel x86 PC’s called the Universal Synchronous / Asynchronous Receiver / Transmitter (USART).  This chip allows two important processes that are required for any type of two-way communications.  Input and Output of data can be sent to and from this chip which therefore makes it possible to build a link to another of it’s kind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the summer of 1997 I worked for a period of four months on a contract for a company called the Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) Northern Ireland.  During this time I worked primarily within the Computing Department of the organization and our team was involved with all the Information Technology issues across the various offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper will look at the two main areas of leadership and team working as I learned a great deal while working there.  The main Information Technology department comprised of a Systems Manager with three main Network Managers working for him and staff working under the database managers for various computing related jobs. To give an idea of the responsibilities of the staff within the computing department I will list briefly what each position has entailed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The information gathered for this essay on social space and the European Social Chapter was obtained from various sources.  These included Internet sites listed in the Bibliography and numerous books and material from the University of Ulster Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will attempt to show how the benefits for and the objectives against the European Social Chapter affect social space within various countries in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;european-social-space&#34;&gt;EUROPEAN SOCIAL SPACE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind social space within the European Union has highlighted certain areas of concern within countries of the European Union.  Employment, industrial health, social costs of industry, labour mobility and social spending within these countries are all elements dealt within European Social Space.  Social space also involves education, training, housing and health.  Over recent years the issues of social welfare have become extremely important as the EU has grown.  One of the main reasons for this is that public expectations have increased rapidly that their governments will play a major role in improving overall quality of life, bringing social affairs firmly into the public domain.  It is only over recent years that the idea of Social Space within the European Union has become a vital factor to the expansion of the EC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Manpower Planning Versus Human Resource Planning</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/manpower-planning-versus-human-resource-planning/</link>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/manpower-planning-versus-human-resource-planning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The differences between manpower planning and human resource planning will be outlined within this essay along with how human resource planning has built on and developed traditional manpower planning. The main sources of information to compile this assignment have come mostly from Coleraine and Jordanstown University of Ulster Libraries and the books used and referred to have been listed in the references and bibliography section of this essay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;manpower-planning&#34;&gt;MANPOWER PLANNING&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason the process of manpower planning came about was to help the management of employees within a business organization.  Manpower planning looks at the organizations current and future need of labour within the business.  The current and future employment needs are a great concern and the examination of supply within the local area for possible new employees if required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tesco - Marketing Strategy in Northern Ireland</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Early in 1996 the supermarket giant Tesco bought over the complete Stewarts / Crazy Prices group for an investment of £641 million.  By 24th November 1996 Crazy Prices, Abbeycentre had been converted to Tesco, Abbeycentre after several other branches including Carrickfergus had undergone the same changeover earlier on in the year.  Although many of the objectives of the company remain the same there are noticeable changes that have occurred within the company as a whole. I will not be focusing on the past ‘Crazy Prices / Stewarts / West Side Stores’ supermarkets therefore as all of my research has been based around the newer Tesco developments&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In any kind of work or study, we always bring a certain set of beliefs as well as philosophical assumptions.  Qualitative researchers understand the importance of beliefs and theories that inform their work and also actively write about them in their research. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
