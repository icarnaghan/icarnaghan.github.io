Unfortunately many of the conveniences of online services come at a price. As software systems have become more advanced so too have the criminals who seek to breach these systems to their own end. Computers have evolved to the point where the information stored now “contain wedding videos, scanned family photos, music libraries, movie collections, and financial and medical records.” (Vacca, 2009) Vast amounts of information is being stored online in newer cloud based services which is creating even larger targets for cybercriminals. Consumers have put their trust in many corporate organizations who handle their sensitive data to protect it adequately from those who would seek to steal or destroy it.

This article examines a popular news organization’s web presence and evaluates this resource in terms of human centered design and cognition. It explores the website’s effectiveness of compiling and distributing news information in a way that is easy for humans to comprehend and process. Much of the focus has been on the main homepage of the website; however other site pages have been taken into consideration adding context to some of the discussion.

Advanced systems used in airports from customer ticketing and check-in, immigration and customs to air traffic control are all depended on daily to maintain operations involving vast numbers of customers travelling throughout the world. These systems must be secured from a number of threats. First and foremost, an international airport must be prepared for threats to its physical infrastructure including natural disasters as well as the danger of deliberate attacks. Risks involved with untrustworthy employees or consultants should be appropriately mitigated through necessary systems permissions and auditing. External threats of cyber attacks either through the airport’s website booking system or other vulnerable gaps within the information systems must be adequately addressed. Operations within an airport that are vital to human safety must take a high priority with regards to security investment.
