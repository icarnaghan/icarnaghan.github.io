But when we see how it has evolved in that time, we see that Nintendo has made the right choice by focusing on quality over quantity. Super Smash Bros. Brawl succeeds an episode GameCube already very convincing and dethrones without difficulty. Just start the software, the player is literally bombarded by an avalanche of game modes, new to most, and can only kneel before the proper amazing range of characters available.

A change that should delight all those for whom the name of Mario is totally separated from the platforms type, which at least has the merit of renewing a few things. It is hoped however that Nintendo has not drawn a line on the concept of the Mario RPG, but it is likely that the next title will be rather light on DS. Nevertheless, Super Paper Mario is not just a platform game, it is above all a constant source of amazement as it demonstrated creativity in both its playful design and design graph. The result is very refreshing and proves that the field of video game is full of hidden concepts waiting to finally be exploited.

The system evolution at the heart of this might he not have to change, or worse, distorting the very spirit of the series and the formula for Super Mario 64? Legitimate concerns, but in vain, since the idea to move Mario in a galaxy appears to be the key that opens the very doors of renewal and that allows him to leave behind him all his previous adventures.

So if Resident Evil 4 is still an excellent title on Wii, there is nothing new to his colleagues if not at the game console to own. Out of this, so it will still be entitled to the entire positive that this adjustment has the additions of the PS2 and PC versions starting with a game mode missing from the GameCube version: Separate Ways. The latter, like the assignment mode, you will lead the beautiful Ada throughout five missions. From the pure value added, especially the way that we proposed to visit a new decor and new looking kinematics. But before discussing this in detail, let us look at the original script.

Exhausted by years of wandering and fighting, he could push past his fight against the Dahaka and the curse of the sands of time, the Prince of Persia was an illusion to believe that he would finally know peace. But fate hounds brave men, and most recently, the tired hero takes up arms to face his worst enemy: himself. The scenario of evil Prince of Persia: Rival Swords is one of those who make you want to make a novel. All players who have overcome the hardships of the first two components together with the Prince know that we cannot forever endure such tortures without paying the price. Returned to Babylon with Kaileena, the Empress troubling time, the prince, nobody knows the name, discovers a city ravaged by war, a kingdom invaded by rivals more cruel than those which it has dealt so far. Therefore, the story starts quickly, leaving not even the soul time to break under the harsh fate that has befallen him. Victim of a conspiracy organized by a manipulative and tyrannical Vizier, Kaileena is killed in front of his eyes. Prince powerless to release the sands of time, even letting himself be contaminated by those who make the chew from the inside, corrupting his soul to bring out the evil that is in him and materialize in the form of sadistic entity: the Dark Prince. From a quality equivalent to the Two Kingdoms on GameCube, the achievement is as compelling and captivating. The opposition between the high and low quoted cities renews perfectly sets and the atmosphere that emanates from, and the animations are still among the very best at the moment.

The latter told me that I could not find the right words to describe what I was invaded by discovering Okami. Thus, paradoxical as it may seem, the doubt comes knocking at my door just as many blank pages await my impressions I sleep to tell you my journey, the same one that made me assume the role a Japanese divinity which has been a difficult task to restore color to a world fallen into a torpor monochromatic. The exercise is all the more difficult it is a kind of homage to a still-born point that deserved its deadly fate. But this is not the time for tears, if not joy, because constrained and forced, I am ready to really start this test and tell you about one of my best gaming events since I looked on my very first Game & Watch.
