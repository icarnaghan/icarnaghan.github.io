      <description>&lt;p&gt;Affiliate programs are great alternatives to PPC and CPC networks. Once you join an AP, you&amp;rsquo;ll get access to tools that will allow you to build affiliate links. A webmaster/website owner must use the tool to generate affiliate links. Once you generate a link, paste it into the blog posts. When a visitor clicks the link and buys a product from a website, you&amp;rsquo;ll earn a commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To know how your site is performing and which URLs on your website are giving you leads, the affiliate programs features a reporting section. There are 1000s of affiliate programs, but the ones that pay affiliates the highest commission fee are mentioned below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In you&amp;rsquo;re not in the US, sending and receiving payment from an affiliate marketing service operating in the US can be a headache. PayPal is the first choice of many freelancers, bloggers, etc. But in the last 2 to 3 years, Payoneer has emerged as a great alternative to PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payoneer is a reliable service and many leading marketing services support it. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve received about $200 without any hassles. I&amp;rsquo;m using this payment service to receive commissions from Amazon Associates US, ThemeForest, and ShareASale affiliate programs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular affiliate program. Until December 2016, the user had to place affiliate URLs manually in the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual method of inserting affiliate URLs in the blog post is cumbersome. The user should first create affiliate link using the Amazon Site Stripe tool or with the AA dashboard. Then, they must use the WordPess post editor to insert the affiliate URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon, for the first time, has introduced a WordPress plugin that lets users find products on Amazon and create affiliate links for them from the WordPress dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best Affiliate Link Cloaker Plugin for Wordpress</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/best-affiliate-link-cloaker-plugin-for-wordpress/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Affiliate links are ugly and long. When the user hovers your mouse on an affiliate link and finds your tracking code in the URL, he may not click the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not a seasoned webmaster, you should use a plugin to create and manage affiliate links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GoCodes was one of the best affiliate link Cloaker plugins. I was using it until I update the PHP on my VPS server. Unfortunately, the plugin has become useless because it has not been updated for 2 years. GoCodes will not work on sites using the latest version of PHP because several functions that GoCodes uses have been deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
