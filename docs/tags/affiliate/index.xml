      <guid>http://localhost:1313/top-8-best-business-listing-sites-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The number of internet users has grown from 100 to 3+ billion. Although a lot of firms have benefited from the internet revolution, many businesses have become bankrupt. eCommerce platforms have destroyed the business of 1000s of brick and mortar stores. The only way to survive the wrath of these sites is to make people aware of your shop/service and the products you sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listing a business online is the best way to promote it. Although there are 100s of sites where you can list your office, shop, or service, not all sites are trustworthy or complete. Businesses won&amp;rsquo;t benefit from such sites. Hence, they should not be listed on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best IDE for PHP Web Development</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PHP is a scripting language that powers over some of the busiest websites on the web. Several languages have been introduced since 2005. None of them have affected the popularity of PHP. Before IDEs were launched, seasoned developers and beginners used vi or notepad to write PHP code. Once the code was ready, developers moved the PHP file to the webapps folder of the web server to check whether their code is working as expected or not. If the browser didn&amp;rsquo;t display error, developers used to check log files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlike search engines that rank pages on the basis of various factors, Social networking portals display posts in groups and on pages in first-in-last-out order. If the page is old, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to scroll down the group until you find it. If the title of the post is interesting, people will share the post on their profiles or in groups they&amp;rsquo;ve joined. Such pages are called viral posts. They have the potential of bringing a large amount of traffic to a website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to limit CPU usage on server effectively?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/how-to-limit-cpu-usage-on-server-effectively/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/how-to-limit-cpu-usage-on-server-effectively/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most hosting companies have introduced 2+ plans. The price of the hosting depends on the hardware and software the company is offering the customer. A plan that offers a low amount of RAM or a single core processor will be less expensive as compared to a plan that provides heaps of system memory and CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what plan you use, you must always keep an eye on the server CPU usage. If you don&amp;rsquo;t do so, a user process may use up to 90 - 100% CPU and other applications/system processes won&amp;rsquo;t be able to execute their tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The AI domain extension was launched in 1994/1995 for the use of companies and individuals based in a Carribean country Anguilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, the world&amp;rsquo;s largest search engine doesn&amp;rsquo;t display the information of Anguilla when you enter the search phrase as &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo;. Even Bing displays Artificial Intelligence search results for the search phrase &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In computer science, AI is an abbreviation for Artificial Intelligence. AI programs are self-learning applications that can be used for various purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because of erroneous PHP and Java extensions, I&amp;rsquo;ve switched from Atom to Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s VSCode aka Visual Code Editor for writing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VSCode is a powerful editor. With the help of some extensions, you can use VSCode as a replacement for RAM hogging Integrated Development Environments.&lt;/p&gt;

The Gzip file&amp;rsquo;s size is significantly lower than the original file. Nginx supports 9 Gzip compression levels.1 is the lowest and 9 is the highest. To gzip a file, Nginx will use invoke a function and the function will use system resources during the file conversion process. The function will take few milliseconds to execute.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting a new blog is easy but making it popular is difficult. People find blogging as one of the easiest ways to make money online. Well, making money through a blog is not a piece of cake. Only websites getting decent traffic generate revenue for their owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful blogger is one who earns enough money only to feed his family and pay internet and web hosting bills. Frankly speaking, the website&amp;rsquo;s fate depends on the traffic. If a site is getting traffic, it will make money for the owner. If it hardly gets visitors, it is of no use to the owner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/how-to-test-wordpress-plugins-online-without-installing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If your site is getting good traffic, and if a new version of the plugin you&amp;rsquo;re using has been launched, you&amp;rsquo;ll have the following two questions in the mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will the plugin break your site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the plugin worth installing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the plugins are thoroughly tested before launch, it may have some bugs. If you install the update, your site may crash or it may add HTML code which may affect your site&amp;rsquo;s ranking in Google or Bing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/how-to-disable-or-noindex-wordpress-attachment-pages/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Attachment page is the built-in feature of WordPress. When these pages are not handled correctly by the website owner, Google and other search engines will index them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress attachments are thin pages that don&amp;rsquo;t add any value to a blog. These pages should be used only on personal or photography blogs wherein you want the visitors to comment on the pictures, videos, and other media files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide an option to turn off or disable these pages. However, you can use third-party plugins to manage them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though I have a technical background, I was not comfortable in moving my sites during my initial days of online career. At that time, 2 of my biggest worries were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorrect site configuration can lead to tons of soft 404 or 404 errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If DNS isn&amp;rsquo;t configured correctly, search bots and visitors would fail to access my sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my online journey in May 2013. I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my hosting platform and moved my websites several times in the last four years without losing website traffic. Right now, my websites are hosted on an unmanaged Linode cloud server. Before switching to Linode, I used Digital Ocean. To move my sites, I follow the below steps:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Yoast SEO plugin includes an option to import meta description and title tags from other popular plugins. While using other plugins, you may have noindexed or nofollowed some or several posts. There are a couple of plugins that enable you to move settings from AIOSEO to Yoast. Unfortunately, none of the plugins provide an option to bulk move noindex posts. People noindex posts to recover from Google quality updates or prevent penalty during an algorithm update.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Top 5 Best WordPress directory theme (2018)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/top-5-best-wordpress-directory-theme-2018/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/top-5-best-wordpress-directory-theme-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A directory site has a massive listing of businesses. If a site is successful, it will have a listing of 1000+ business. A small site may have fewer listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEO plays a key role in deciding the fate of a directory site. A well-optimized website will rank high in search engines. A good example of this is Yelp, a large restaurant directory site that ranks at number 1 position in Google SERPs for several 1000 keywords. We must not forget that Yelp has 100s of employees working 24 x 7.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best way to Auto Tag WordPress posts</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/best-way-to-auto-tag-wordpress-posts/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/best-way-to-auto-tag-wordpress-posts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress tags are important, no matter how small or large a site is. Tags allow users to group posts. They make website navigation easier. They allow search engines to discover and index new posts quickly. WordPress Related posts plugins use tags to calculate post relevancy and display related articles below blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings make mistakes. Sometimes, a webmaster may delete an important tag unintentionally. Once a tag is removed, the structure of the related post on your site may change. If you have a small blog with 10 to 20 posts, readding tags manually shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem. If you own a large site, readding tags to posts is an annoying task. The best way to add tags to blog posts is to use Automatic Post Tagger WordPress plugin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started my online career with a site hosted on Godaddy. I switched to A Small Orange from Godaddy after finding its plans cheap. After a major DNS incident, I quit ASO and bought shared hosting plan from Hostgator. HG shared plans are great for growing sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traffic to my site grew and I had launched a few more sites. To make sure that HG doesn&amp;rsquo;t ban my sites by high server resource usage, I bought unmanaged Hostgator VPS plan. The VPS had 512 MB RAM. Everything was going great. When I was holidaying at my native place, my sites were down for 8 hours. To find the reason for this, I logged into the server to go through PHP, Nginx, MySQL log, and system log files. The system log file had several &amp;ldquo;MYSQL server has gone away&amp;rdquo; entries. This problem occurs when the system doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough free memory for MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

PayPal is the first choice of many freelancers, bloggers, etc. But in the last 2 to 3 years, Payoneer has emerged as a great alternative to PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payoneer is a reliable service and many leading marketing services support it. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve received about $200 without any hassles. I&amp;rsquo;m using this payment service to receive commissions from Amazon Associates US, ThemeForest, and ShareASale affiliate programs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I was checking the performance of one of my sites with GTmetrix and Pingdom tools. Although my site takes about 1 second to open in any browser, the tools were reporting remove query strings from static resources warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything that follows after the question mark i.e &amp;ldquo;?&amp;rdquo; is called a query string. You&amp;rsquo;ll find URLs with query strings on dynamic sites. If the site serves static content, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to use them. The website I&amp;rsquo;m talking about is a small blog. Hence, I decided to get rid of the warning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m using SSL for the first time and having several doubts in mind, I decided to renew LetsEncrypt certificate immediately. I fired the following command in the Linux terminal (10 days prior the certificate&amp;rsquo;s expiry date) and restarted Nginx.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A theme is responsible for the success of a blogger. Many bloggers end up buying a theme which looks attractive but scores 0 when it comes to SEO. Despite publishing high-quality content on their sites, these bloggers don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy success and they quit blogging&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a newbie blogger, I had committed a huge mistake of trusting a third class theme developer. The developer rolled out an update which created the dreaded duplicate title, meta description problem on my site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After Google declared HTTPS as a ranking signal, thousands of sites have switched to HTTPS from HTTP. To secure your site with HTTPS, you must install an SSL certificate on the server and configure the web server to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt Certificate Authority was launched in 2016, companies used to charge a hefty amount for providing SSL certificates. Now, you can easily get free SSL certificates to secure your personal or business portal, thanks to Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is the best WordPress permalink structure for SEO?</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/what-is-the-best-wordpress-permalink-structure-for-seo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress saves the permalink of the page/post in a database table. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t generate them on the fly. Hence, you can change the structure of the post/page URL anytime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should avoid changing permalinks often because it complicates your site. When you change the URL structure, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to redirect the old URL to the newer URL with a proper HTTP status code. If you don&amp;rsquo;t implement the redirect correctly, your site&amp;rsquo;s traffic from search engines will decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you may want to display widgets only on certain pages of a site. If you&amp;rsquo;ve knowledge of PHP, you can show/hide widgets with just 2 lines of codes. The 1st line will have the PHP if else condition to detect the current page or term. If the condition you&amp;rsquo;ve specified in the if statement is true, then the code inside the if block must be executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The block must have the shortcode or code to display the required widget. It is the 2nd line of our code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Site deindexed from Google is the worst nightmare for any blogger or business owner. When Google removes your site from its index, your AdSense earnings are down by 70 to 90%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If traffic from social networks to your site is high, you can recover the earnings by becoming an affiliate marketer. If your site doesn&amp;rsquo;t get good traffic from Facebook, Twitter or any other social site, your website will be of no use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>HTTP to HTTPS migration: Important thing you should know</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/http-to-https-migration-important-thing-you-should-know/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to Google, HTTPS is a ranking signal. If you make your website secure by configuring the web server to deliver HTTPS pages, your site may rank higher than an HTTP only portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, web browsers have begun to warn their users of non-secure web pages. The Google Chrome browser (version 56) marks non-https website pages as insecure when they have an HTML field for entering passwords, credit or debit card details, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/how-to-set-preferred-domain-correctly-in-google-search-console/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Setting a preferred domain is one of the most important things to do after launching a new site. It takes few seconds to set a PD. Before setting a preferred domain, you should make sure that Google indexes only the URLS which you want to appear in search results. To do so, you must set up a 301 redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 301 redirect will prevent duplicate content issues. It will tell search engines that they should index the correct web pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nginx is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most powerful web servers. It has a robust caching system which eliminates the need for optimizing websites with third-party caching solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While managing your website, you may come across the strange error called No Space Left on Device while reading upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;rsquo;t know that Nginx is throwing the &amp;ldquo;No Space Left error&amp;rdquo; until you check the HTTP response header or go through the log files. To see the response header, install the Redirect Path Chrome extension or use the online redirect checker tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/search-traffic-dropped-after-switching-to-https-try-these-solutions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;HTTPS protocol makes your website secure. Google had declared HTTPS as a ranking signal last year which means that secure sites can have higher organic visibility than nonsecure websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your site is selling products online, you&amp;rsquo;ll see a boost in conversion because the browsers will mark your website as safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you go ahead and enable HTTPS on your website, you must learn the Google Content Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you enable HTTP secure protocol, Google will crawl and index all HTTPS URLS it finds on your website. It then checks the HTTP version of the URLS to learn whether the webmaster has implemented proper redirects or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in one of our blog posts, duplicate content is not good for the site&amp;rsquo;s health. When Google refreshes the Panda Algorithm, the search traffic of sites with duplicate content are affected the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webmasters with experience of creating search engine friendly sites by following the Google Webmaster Guidelines take care of content issues caused by the content management system. But they can&amp;rsquo;t identify scrapped content unless their site&amp;rsquo;s search engine traffic is impacted by a Google Algorithm Update.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular affiliate program. Until December 2016, the user had to place affiliate URLs manually in the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual method of inserting affiliate URLs in the blog post is cumbersome. The user should first create affiliate link using the Amazon Site Stripe tool or with the AA dashboard. Then, they must use the WordPess post editor to insert the affiliate URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon, for the first time, has introduced a WordPress plugin that lets users find products on Amazon and create affiliate links for them from the WordPress dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/best-wordpress-widgets-for-your-blog-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Widgets are one of the most impressive and powerful features of the WordPress content management system. They make your website look attractive and user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you install WordPress, the CMS will add up to 10 different widgets to your blog or website. These widgets have limited functionality. Furthermore, they&amp;rsquo;re not customizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free themes may not add new widgets to your WP site. To add a new widget, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to install a new WP plugin. As a blogger, you should know that too many plugins may slow down your website. If the plugin is badly programmed, it will lead to high server resource consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Guys, you may have seen the &amp;ldquo;Leverage browser caching&amp;rdquo; warning when you test your website&amp;rsquo;s speed with the Google page speed insights tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finding this message, you head over to Google and search methods to increase cache expiry time. After reading a tutorial on increasing expiry time for static content i.e. JavaSript, CSS files, you go ahead and modify the htaccess or Nginx configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know that if you set an abnormal expiration value to the static files (say 30 days or more), you may be committing a big mistake!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It shows ratings only for the portals having schema markups and in-depth content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing the content is up to the user, but one can easily add schema codes to their site by referring the official guidelines. Modern content management systems provide extensions to add review boxes to their site and add the Schema markup code for the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Web hosting is the backbone of a website. It is crucial to the success of a blogger, business, and the website. A poor web hosting firm will have big downtimes. Because of poor infrastructure, the network latency will be high and your site will rank below faster websites in the search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web hosting services are of three types, shared, VPS, dedicated, and cloud. The shared hosting plans are the cheapest of the three. They are ideal for small sites owned by newbie webmasters and beginners. VPS and dedicated plans are costly as compared to shared. They are suitable for business or larger websites owned by experienced webmasters. Cloud platforms are suitable for websites whose traffic may explode anytime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I have addressed one major issue the WordPress users face i.e. HTTP error on uploading media or image files. I encountered this error yesterday while trying to upload a picture in my latest blog post. The picture uploader tool was repeatedly throwing cannot upload error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I logged into the server and checked PHP error log files generated by the website and PHP web server. The files were clean. I checked WP memory limit in the wp-config.php file. The memory allocated to my site was 64 megabytes and all my sites were using 15% of the allocated system memory. Hence, I ruled out the low memory issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They introduced a mobile-friendly testing tool for webmasters and launched page layout algorithm which affects rankings of ad-heavy desktop/mobile sites. In 2016, Google launched a new concept called Accelerated Mobile Pages. After testing AMP on a bunch of top news website, Google now allows all websites to use AMP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to fix White Screen of Death Problem?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/how-to-fix-white-screen-of-death-problem/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like the Blue screen of death error, the WSOD is the most commonly reported error. The white screen problem occurs because of few lines of code crashing the entire application. Experienced programmers can fix the issue in a few minutes. If a novice user who hired a freelancer or uses a content management system sees the white screen, he should follow the below two methods to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wsod-in-sites-other-than-cms&#34;&gt;WSOD in sites other than CMS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see the white screen of death, the first thing you should do is check log files. Unless you change the path of log files in the server&amp;rsquo;s config file, the web and DB server creates log files in the /var/ directory in Linux. In most of the cases, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the root cause problem for the WSOD problem in these files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google has indexed over a billion web pages. It is the largest search engine in the world. Millions of sites depend on traffic from Google to earn revenue. Hence, when engineers working at Google roll out a new update, the SEO experts are excited and equally worried hoping that their or client sites don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo; lose traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days back, the head of webspam at Google revealed that the much awaited Penguin 4.0 algorithm update is now in action. The Algoroo graph indicated massive fluctuations in search engine results starting from September 1. It seems like Google began testing the Penguin 4.0 update from 1st September onward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress is a great content management system because it allows users to launch a new self-hosted blog or website within half an hour. Launching a site is easy but you&amp;rsquo;ll not make money with it if the site doesn&amp;rsquo;t get decent traffic from search engines. To make sure that the site is SEO friendly, you must write good quality content, buy a good hosting plan, and purchase a premium theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SEO is not a child&amp;rsquo;s play. One wrong setting can impact search engine rankings dramatically. Although WordPress is a decade old CMS and powers millions of sites, it is still suffering from various SEO issues. To fix the problem, the must install one of the 100s of SEO plugins available in the WordPress repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should not install plugins which have poor ratings and promise plenty of features. I did the same mistake in the past and I still regret it. In the year 2013, my site lost 90 to 95% organic traffic because of a bad WordPress SEO plugin. Today, the best SEO plugins provide plenty of useful features. They let users optimize their site for higher local search rankings, add breadcrumbs to the website, add XML sitemaps, etc. Moreover, they work great.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A log file generated by a web/database server is one of the most important files. It contains useful information on visitors, errors, warnings, etc. Some people think log files as server resource killer. Hence, they disable them in Apache, DB or NGINX configuration file. One more reason why people disable or ignore server logs is because the content of logs is difficult to understand. Hence, most noob webmasters use a log file analyzer program to check server logs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The black background of the text editor soothes my eyes. The text color is great and the interface of the Atom editor is awesome. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like the default Look and Feels, you are free to change it as per your preference or download a new Atom theme. My favorite color is black so I don&amp;rsquo;t find it necessary to change the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atom editor gets updates on a regular basis. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve started using the editor, GitHub has rolled out many updates. Each update makes the editor better. I&amp;rsquo;m interested only in code. Hence, I haven&amp;rsquo;t checked the full features of Atom editor. For me, Atom is the best tool for web development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is BlogSpot or Blogger safe, better than WordPress?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/is-blogspot-or-blogger-safe-better-than-wordpress/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/is-blogspot-or-blogger-safe-better-than-wordpress/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Blogspot and blogger are the two faces of the same coin. Blogger was known as Blogspot but when Google bought it, people started calling the site Blogger. Google hasn&amp;rsquo;t destroyed Blogspot. Sites that are hosted on it are identified by the following domain name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;site_name.blogspot.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;is-blogspot-safe&#34;&gt;Is BlogSpot safe?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Google owns Blogger, it is a much safer website than a self-hosted WP blog. If you enable two-factor authentication, it will be impossible for a hacker to take over your site because blogger asks users to enter their Gmail password to log into their profile. All websites powered by Google are secure. Have you ever heard that Gmail or Google got hacked?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you don&amp;rsquo;t know this, you are probably a newbie or an immature SEO professional. Here are the three important things that you should know as a Sear Engine Optimization professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;emd-domains-rank&#34;&gt;EMD domains rank&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can give 10 good examples that exact match domain names rank high for the keywords. Google starts ranking EMD sites only after a certain time period. The sites using EMD have 100s of polished articles with an average content length of 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I own a laptop which has a dedicated graphics card. I am a developer who prefers using Linux OS. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried 3 distros of Linux, Mint, Ubuntu, OpenSuse. No matter what version of Linux I use, the OS fails to recognize the AMD graphics card in my laptop and the WiFi connection always drops. I fixed the WiFi issue by upgrading the driver but the GPU installation always fails. Hence, I decided to give up using Linux and stick with Windows 10 OS for development tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two of the most commonly used terms by bloggers and webmasters are backlinks and content. A site must have both else it will not rank in first seven pages of world&amp;rsquo;s busiest and largest search engine, Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backlinks aka inbound links are the most important criteria Google considers for ranking content of a website in their pages. One can easily prove this. Search for a product in Google. Popular sites with 1000s of backlinks will occupy first few pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AdSense is a great platform for making money online. But getting approved for it or having a five or six figure AdSense revenue is a difficult task. People have a misunderstanding that GA is the only advertiser with which they can make them rich. They are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is predictable in the world of internet. Hence, you should always try out different strategies for maximizing revenue from the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many methods of monetizing a website. This is what I have learned from my 3 years of experience as a blogger. People make a mistake by depending only on AdSense aka a single source for their earnings. They don&amp;rsquo;t experiment with other monetization programs aka AdSense alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/how-to-compress-or-minify-html-of-a-wordpress-site/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minification is a process of stripping whitespaces and comments of a page. When you minify a web page, the visitors to your website will experience faster browsing experience on their desktop or mobile device. The page speed insights tool will not request you to minify HTML, JS, or CSS code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you minify HTML, CSS or JS code on your website, the server will send a small page to the client. The file size is yet another factor in determining the page speed of a website. The browser on the client device will download a smaller file faster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was thinking about registering a new domain name for my new project. My first choice was GoDaddy. I had shortlisted a few TLDs from GoDaddy, but I was not able to buy a domain name for less than 10$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GoDaddy runs a promotion wherein new customers can register a TLD for USD 0.99. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using GoDaddy for three years. Hence, I was not eligible for this offer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Affiliate links are ugly and long. When the user hovers your mouse on an affiliate link and finds your tracking code in the URL, he may not click the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not a seasoned webmaster, you should use a plugin to create and manage affiliate links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GoCodes was one of the best affiliate link Cloaker plugins. I was using it until I update the PHP on my VPS server. Unfortunately, the plugin has become useless because it has not been updated for 2 years. GoCodes will not work on sites using the latest version of PHP because several functions that GoCodes uses have been deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s not only the core that gets regular updates, but plugins and theme developers also publish latest versions of their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WP-CMS, themes, and plugins get better with every new release. Only the folks who work at Automattic INC know when WordPress update will be released. When a developer releases a newer version of his/her theme or plugin, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a notification for the same in the WP dashboard. The big problem with WordPress is that users will have to update their plugins, core files, and theme manually.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1000s of WordPress websites are hacked every day because the hackers are aware of the security loopholes in plugins and themes that the website is using. Usually, the websites that use outdated or nulled WordPress plugins and themes fall prey to hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are incidents where websites that use powerful WordPress security plugins are hacked. To keep your WordPress website or blog safe, you must back up the database and images on regular basis. You should also use a WordPress security plugin and tweak web server settings to minimize threats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Blog Commenting is the Worst Link Building Strategy?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Blog commenting is the worst strategy of link building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many pro bloggers recommend their followers to drop a comment on high page rank or high domain authority blogs (with similar niche). I think, this is the worst tip ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you seen the pro bloggers comment on other blogs which are more popular and have higher DA than their websites? The answer is no. Pro bloggers know that commenting on other sites will result in low-quality backlinks and their website&amp;rsquo;s traffic might be affected by this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Buying a premium WordPress theme ensures that you&amp;rsquo;ll be given assistance when you encounter problems with the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme will have clean code and it will be search engine and mobile friendly. Unfortunately, the premium theme which I used earlier on this blog was a waste of my money. I had bought it when I was a newbie blogger after reading a review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme was good initially, but the developer removed its inbuilt review system. When I asked the development team why they did so? They asked me to wait for a few weeks because they&amp;rsquo;ll be launching a review plugin. It has been 5 months now, the plugins have not been released yet. All my reviews and the schema start rating markups were gone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost every website visit you visit uses an analytics tool to track visitors and their activity. Only the organization that own its will have access to the tracking data. The company doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any reason to make their data public unless they&amp;rsquo;re generating advertising revenue from the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people using the internet are always curious to know how much traffic does their favorite website get. But as I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned earlier, the real data is with the site&amp;rsquo;s owner. Thus, no matter what tool you use, you cannot get the exact statistics of a website traffic unless the company decides to share it with the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TTFB aka first-byte time is nothing but the time taken by the first byte to reach the client machine when the client seeks a response from the server after the browser running on it makes an HTTP GET request. A small TTFB value indicates that your web server is fast. A high TTFB value denotes that your site is slow in responding to the browser&amp;rsquo;s HTTP GET request. To fix the problem, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to work on the code or check web server and DB configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pay per click advertisement platforms is the best way to monetize a blog. When it comes to the best PPC networks, nothing beats Google Adsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA is the most widely used PPC platform. It has 10 to 100 times better CPC rates than Chitika, InFolinks, Bidvertiser, etc. Thus, your first monetization option should always be Adsense. If your AdSense application gets disapproved, you should make your website better before resubmitting the application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a regular reader of this blog, you may have noticed that this site was throwing error establishing database connection or internal server errors last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue which was caused by the Linux out of memory manager has now been fixed, and the site is now live 24 x 7. I&amp;rsquo;m using this server to host some other WordPress websites as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing the error was a very confusing task for me. To be honest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about OOM process killer in Linux. If I knew how this module worked, the error would have been fixed on the day the error message appeared the system log file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since two weeks, my website was frequently crashing because the MySQL server stopped abruptly at random times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue started when I was on a holiday. My site was down for several hours. I configured crontab to start MySQL server when the service had stopped. This didn&amp;rsquo;t help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enabled query cache to reduce the load on the server. I use NGINX Fast CGI cache, APCu, and OpCache for my sites. Thus, I didn&amp;rsquo;t felt the need to install a caching plugin for my WordPress blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The image is one of the most important elements of a blog post. It not only makes the post attractive but also helps in improving the website&amp;rsquo;s search engine visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when you update a blog post, you may replace the image/pictures in it with some other pictures. Many users don&amp;rsquo;t bother to delete the old images from the uploads directory of wp-content WordPress installation folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a site grows larger, the uploads folder may have tons of unused images. These files waste storage memory, and they impact system&amp;rsquo;s performance. To delete or remove these files, download the Media Cleaner plugin and install it on your WordPress website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shared hosting plans are suitable for beginners and people with no knowledge of PHP, MySQL and Web servers. In a shared hosting, the company offers PhpMyAdmin, CPanel, Awstats (Google Analytics Alternative) and many more tools to make website configuration or deployment easier for a webmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared hosting comes with several limitations. Your site will be hosted with several other web portals, and it will have limited resource to use. Bandwidth usage will be a matter of concern. You are not allowed to experiment with PHP MySQL modules. Nor you can switch from Apache/Nginx to some other web server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Email marketing is probably incomplete without a good newsletter plugins that add subscription forms in our WordPress sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of free plugins to add newsletter forums to a website, but the features they offer are limited. For example, the MailChimp plugin doesn&amp;rsquo;t support popups, and it lacks an Ajax based form which makes the sign-up process fast. You can only change the background and button color with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All my websites are hosted on an unmanaged VPS. The VPS has enough of RAM and a decent CPU. It can handle ten high traffic blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never faced any problems until last week when my website started displaying error establishing a database connection to the visitors instead of the content. This error was reported after I changed one of the table&amp;rsquo;s structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-the-heck-did-i-change-the-structure&#34;&gt;Why the heck did I change the structure?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I noticed Yarpp plugin displayed a message that I need to replace the table structure of my post content table from INNODB to MYISAM so that the plugin can display highly relevant related posts. So I changed the structure of my website&amp;rsquo;s DB table.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A self hosted platform is one which allows you to install a blog software of your choice on a shared, cloud or a VPS server. It gives you freedom to use any type of extension or plugin you wish to use. Self hosted sites are easy to set up. To do so, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to buy a hosting plan from a reputed company like Hostgator, Bluehost, Siteground, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WP login.php is the most critical page on a WordPress website. Without it, you will not be able to access the WP-admin area aka the WP dashboard and other users will not be able to register an account with your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No website owner would ever want a hacker or an intruder to get full access to the WP-admin area. If they do manage to get its access, intruders will delete your website, change admin password or remove all your post/pages. To avoid this, you should secure the WordPress login page by:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress saves the post, settings and other data related to your website in an MSQL database. The DB is handled by the user through CMS with a DB management plugin or through a command line terminal from a remote computer (on unmanaged hosting environment).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before buying any product from a website or before contacting a business, search engine users will go through the reviews. If the reviews are negative, the user may not communicate with the business or he&amp;rsquo;ll leave the website without making any purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers are the best people to judge a product and the best way to get their feedback is by adding a review section to the website. Reviews may help in improving the rankings of a website as it may have many new keywords.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google PR is dead, and it will never be updated in the future. Advertisers have started using Moz rank and domain authority to know whether a website is ranking high in search engines or not. One more important factor they consider for checking the popularity of a website is the Alexa rank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 100s of fonts that you can use for free, but you will have to spend a lot of time in searching for them unless you use Google web fonts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The sidebar is one of the most critical section of a website. It not only helps in improving the revenue of a site by allowing users to place adverts above the fold but also helps in decreasing the bounce rate. On WordPress blogs, you&amp;rsquo;ll find banners, related/latest/popular post&amp;rsquo;s widget on the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content you add to the sidebar will be visible on all posts. If there are 1000 posts on your website, each and every advertisement or URL you&amp;rsquo;ll add as a widget will be displayed on each post. You may have grouped your posts in many categories. Suppose there are four categories on your website - phones, laptops, tablets, and desktop. Imagine you&amp;rsquo;ve published an article on a notebook.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you may not like your current WordPress theme, and you may think of replacing it with some other template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Themes allow you to export settings. But the settings you back up will be compatible only with the theme i.e. You can&amp;rsquo;t move settings of a Mythemshop template to TagDiv NewsPaper or Elegant Themes Divi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you change your template, you may have to tweak the design for the best experience of the user. You may also have to change image sizes so that the blog posts don&amp;rsquo;t look horrible or broken.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook allows the webmasters to add the Facebook comment form, like box or the page feed to their websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In WordPress CMS, adding a comment form or the like box is easy, but inserting a page feed is usually a tricky task for a webmaster. Even if the user manages to add FB feed to the sidebar, he won&amp;rsquo;t be able to customize it unless the user knows the working knowledge of CSS. In such cases, the user should use the free custom Facebook feed plugin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress supports taxonomies. In the WP CMS (content management system), the user can create as many tags and categories as they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A category is different from a tag. It is used to build a menu. If you create a treemap of WordPress structure, then the categories will always be the child of index or root page. They make navigation easier for the search bots and the visitors. On a small blog or a website, the webmaster should create only a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dual factor authentication has become one of the most important security features in the last few years. Major websites like Google Mail, Outlook, Facebook are now protecting user accounts in a better way by allowing them to use a mobile device as their identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To activate 2 step authentication, the service provider will ask you to install Google Authenticator app (or any of its alternative). Some websites will ask you to verify the mobile phone number so that the authentication service will send a 4 or 5 digit code when required. This code will be used for one-time verification, and it will be valid only for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to website designing, the User Experience plays a crucial role.

This applies to all websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good way to make sure that your website is effectively generating revenue and the user visits more than one pages of your site, you should add the call to action buttons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On many established blogs, you&amp;rsquo;ll find related or recommended articles in post content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posts are embedded in a stylized &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; or &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; and they attract visitor&amp;rsquo;s attention. They&amp;rsquo;re known as inline related posts (IRP). IRPs, when placed at the right position can reduce the bounce rate of a blog. They can also increase the page-views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established websites have enough revenue to hire a WordPress developer who can write the code to insert content hyperlinks inline of the post automatically after the post has been published.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress is claimed to be one of the most secure content management systems of the decade, but you need to take some precautions while using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The login page is accessible to everyone using the Internet. To access the page, the user has to enter example.com/wp-login.php simply. If you&amp;rsquo;re using a weak password, then a software or a bot can easily hack your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some hackers will target your site with a DOS or DDOS attack. If your hosting provider has not set up a firewall for your account, your website and web server will be down. If the site has many visitors, you&amp;rsquo;ll lose some revenue. If the access to the wp-config file is not restricted, the hacker will get your database name and its password.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My favorite plugin i.e. Quick Adsense has not been updated for over 1.5 years, and it has become unreliable because it has not been tested with latest WordPress versions. I searched the WordPress repository to find a reliable and frequently updated plugin for insert adverts. After a few minutes, I found Advanced ads. I was tempted to try out the plugin after going through its ratings and reviews shared by the real users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Siteground hosting offers various plans that are suitable for deploying new or established websites. Like many other hosting platforms, SG claims to offer 99.9 percent uptime for your site. This is impressive because your blog will be hardly down. Thus your online earnings and revenue will not be impacted by unnecessary downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once my high traffic site was down for 3 hours when it was hosted on ASO, my Adsense earnings for the day were down by a few dollars. With SG, you will never experience such issues because the infrastructure of Siteground hosting company is good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The default WordPress search module is useful, but not the best. No matter what keyword or term you search for, you&amp;rsquo;ll not be satisfied with the results generated by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This module is critical because people use it to find relevant information on your site. It can also reduce the bounce rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the WordPress content management system supports hierarchical pages (categories, tags, authors, attachment pages) that make navigation easy for the visitor, it is always a good decision to add a powerful search function to your blog. Thankfully, we don&amp;rsquo;t have to write PHP code for the same. There are a lot of free WordPress search plugins available for download. But the below two plugins are the best and most powerful among them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People disable comments from their website thinking that spammers or hackers will not target their sites. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s true that this form is always responsible for spam, but you should never think of removing it. Spam can be easily avoided with Akismet or its alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments are an important section of a website. Without it, your blog would look hostile and naked. No one would like to interact with you. Many people buy products from affiliate links only after reading comments. If you remove this form from your website, your conversion will be low. Moreover, the visitor will leave your site as soon as he finishes reading your post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Displaying popular posts in blog sidebar is useful in many ways. As your top articles are posted, the link juice aka page rank will transfer to them which in turn will help your posts rank higher in search engines like Google, Bing, etc. Adding a widget for the same is a good way of strengthening the internal link structure of your website. If your top posts have affiliate links, displaying them in the sidebar will boost your income and conversions. There are a lot of popular post widgets and plugins but the one which I&amp;rsquo;ve shared today is what you&amp;rsquo;re probably looking for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although W3TC has options to configure Memcache and OPCache modules, this plugin requires some configuration to work according to your expectations. It includes many features that you may not want to use. To be honest, W3TC and WPSC are best plugins for Shared hosting users as users can easily make their site faster by activating disk caching, minification or by setting an expiry date for static resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve purchased a VPS package from Hostgator, Bluehost or any other hosting provider, you should try out WP-FFPC. The highlighting feature of this plugin is that it supports various types of web servers and lacks complex features. You can easily run it on NGINX, LightHTTPD, Apache 2 platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The default WordPress commenting system is good, but some people may want to replace it with a third party plugin like Disqus, Livefyre for better control, spam protection, and administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disqus adds a lot of weight to your site, and you should think before using it. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen LiveFyre plugin on high traffic websites, and it looks great. I&amp;rsquo;ve not tested it. In case you&amp;rsquo;re searching for a Disqus or Livefyre alternative for your WordPress site, there&amp;rsquo;s a good new option available for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress is an excellent content management system, but it has a lot of modules that may cause duplicate content problems and many other SEO related issues. Thus anyone using WordPress to power their websites should install an SEO plugin. An excellent plugin will have options to disable unnecessary WordPress features which in turn improves SEO score of your blog. It will take care of meta description, titles, redirects, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of free and premium SEO plugins available for download in the WordPress directory, but people trust just 2 of them - Yoast and All in One SEO. If you&amp;rsquo;re confused in choosing between these two plugins, go through the below paragraphs where we&amp;rsquo;ve covered a detailed comparison of Yoast vs. ALL in One SEO pack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;ve installed a WordPress table plugin on your site. You have 1000 blog posts, and only 10 of them has a table. The Javascript and CSS files for the same will be inserted in the header section, and it will be called on all the pages even though you have not added a table. This increases the page size, and it can affect the page loading time. To solve this problem, you can either write a PHP code that will insert CSS and JS scripts in the site header only when required or you can install WordPress plugin organizer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When a lot of users are commenting on your articles, you should make sure that the comments do not affect the load time of the page. If it is affecting posts load time, the user should enable pagination for the same by navigating to Settings&amp;mdash;&amp;gt; discussions page or he must search for an alternative solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my tech blog&amp;rsquo; posts was having over 150 comments from visitors. The post is well written and has 1500 words in it. Due to a large number of comments, the visitor had to scroll down for more than 10 seconds to navigate to the footer section of my site. The footer is the important section for me because it has links to contact me, privacy policy, disclaimer pages, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shared hosting plans are relatively cheap as compared to VPS or dedicated hosting. This is because your site will be offered around 512MB RAM (or lower) and a CPU, which will be shared by many other websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites that are growing at a very fast rate should always be hosted on VPS servers (use dedicated if you require more RAM). If they&amp;rsquo;re hosted on Shared platform, their account might be suspended because of very high CPU usage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bloggers want a lot of features in their themes. They also expect their WordPress blogs and websites to load fast. Free templates have limited support and features. Thus, many of the bloggers buy a premium template. Before they make payment, the user will explore 100s of available options. This task induces a headache and creates a lot of confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is a job for professional and experienced bloggers like me to make newbies or WordPress users aware of the top themes. Last week, we published a detailed review of Newspaper template. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ve discussed one of the most popular and powerful WordPress theme named X. No other WP template is as perfect and user-friendly as X.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;English is one of the most widely accepted and spoken language around the globe. Whether its a TV or any other electronic device, English is used everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English has more than 2 billion speakers. Due to its importance, it has become an official language in many countries. Although it is used everywhere, let us face a truth that many people do not speak and write good English. There might be many reasons behind this problem, but one of the most common is the grammar. Grammar is vast and many people fail to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many website hosting providers offer better features and more free add-ons but if budget is not a problem for you, choose a product on the basis of its quality, not quantity. Frankly speaking, the best hosting companies in the world are Hostgator and Bluehost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hostgator is a superb platform for hosting websites, but if your site has been banned for high resource utilization or some other reasons, you should consider signing up with Bluehost as it offers similar features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Newspaper themes for WordPress are recommended for technology, travel, health, news, video and sports niche blogs. There are a lot of newspaper and magazine themes available for download in the wordpress.org directory. Most of them claim to be SEO friendly but unfortunately they&amp;rsquo;re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free themes have a major drawback that their support is limited. If you encounter any problems, you will have to post your query on WordPress.org forum. Most of the times, instead of the developers, other users will help you out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best WordPress sitemap plugins for better SEO (2018)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A sitemap is one of the most important elements of a website. It is nothing but an XML document that features all the pages and post of your blog. It should be defined in a correct way. Failing to do so will confuse search engines and the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When users start a new blog, they should immediately create a sitemap and submit it to Google and Bing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly Speaking, these two search engines are smart, and they can determine the structure of your site without a sitemap. But you should add this document to your site as it will be useful for the users (in case they&amp;rsquo;re  looking for it).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have seen fiverr gigs in which people try to sell 1000s of backlinks for just 5 dollars. These people will use an automated tool to build links to authority sites. If they don&amp;rsquo;t have a software, people will drop links in dofollow forums, or they&amp;rsquo;ll use the guest posting technique for the same. When I had started my career as a blogger, I read many blog posts that suggested newbies to build backlinks for getting traffic to my website. I followed this strategy for a while, and after Google algorithm penalized my blog, I had to delete more than 50 articles (with 500+ words) that were linked to dofollow blogs. Backlinks are now considered harmful. You should not buy backlinks or build them because of these two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people think that working from 9 to 5 is a nightmare. Some believe that working from home is a great experience. Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve been in both the situations and thus I can give a better explanation on this topic. I have spent a  year in an IT company. My working time was 9 to 6 or 7. After working for a year, I resigned from the job to be a self-dependent person. I can say that my decision was right as I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved my goal. I am earning decent money, and I am confident that my earnings will increase as the time passes by. Although I work from home and have a source of income, sometimes I feel frustrated because of disturbances from the surrounding. Here are the pros and cons of working from home online and working in a 9 to 5 job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/robots.txt-for-wordpress-useful-tips-and-settings-for-better-seo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google bot and other search spiders will visit the robots.txt file of your website immediately after they hit the htaccess file. Both these files are crucial as they can affect your site&amp;rsquo;s organic presence. Htaccess has rules to block IP addresses, redirect URLs, enable gzip compression, etc. The robots.txt will have a set of rules for the search engines. It has few lines that will either block or allow crawling of files and directories. Google has been penalizing blogs with thin content. If you&amp;rsquo;re a WordPress user, you should be aware of the taxonomies of the CMS. If you have generated many tags on your site, make sure that you make then no index as they&amp;rsquo;ll cause duplicate content issues on your blog. Don&amp;rsquo;t block them in the robots.txt file if you&amp;rsquo;ve enabled tags on single posts. If you don&amp;rsquo;t do this, page rank and link juice will be wasted. No index attribute for tags can be easily added via Yoast plugin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many self-proclaimed SEO experts believe that hiding WordPress date helps in improving search engine rankings. I supported their strategy until I started thinking more about user experience and rich snippets. If you&amp;rsquo;ve come across a post that claims to improve SERP position after removing dates from the blog, you&amp;rsquo;re being misled. Google knows when you&amp;rsquo;ve published a blog post through the sitemap file that has both published/modified dates. So you can&amp;rsquo;t fool it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every content management system has a login page, and dashboard that allows bloggers and webmasters to manage the data published on their site and WordPress is no exception. This page is relevant. Thus it will always be on the attack of website hackers that may/may not use automated program to gain access to your site&amp;rsquo;s dashboard. The default slug to log in to your WordPress dashboard is wp-login.php, and every hacker and WordPress user knows it knows it. Thus if you&amp;rsquo;re using the default password or if you&amp;rsquo;re using weak login credentials, your site might get easily hacked (You can remove the default user i.e., admin through the users page in WP).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;404 errors in WordPress is caused when a user or a search bot is not able to find a page on your site. This page might be linked from your blog post or another website. According to Google webmaster tools, these errors won&amp;rsquo;t affect your site&amp;rsquo;s performance in the search engine, but you should try to get rid of them for a better user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a lot of WordPress 404 errors can do more harm than any other factor.

Thus it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to get rid of 404 errors. You can use the below tips and plugins for the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Registering a domain name is one of the most important activities of a person who wants to make an online career. But managing it and setting up a hosting service can be tricky. Name of a domain should be chosen wisely on the basis of below criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: A DN should have one or 2 keywords that will kelp users understand what your blog/site is all about. The keywords should not contain the names of large enterprises (and their products). For example Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Windows, etc. If you ignore this, you&amp;rsquo;ll face legal action in the future. The company might register a DMCA complaint against your site which will force search engines to remove your blog from their index.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Bio section is important as it makes website users aware of the writer&amp;rsquo;s skills, hobbies, experience, etc. Just like about me, disclaimer, privacy policy pages, the bio section is one of the most useful elements of a WordPress site. Most WordPress themes include the author bio box and to display your information in it, navigate to your profile page by hovering your mouse cursor over users menu (This menu appears on the left side of your WordPress dashboard). If your theme lacks this widget, make sure that you install any of the below plugins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Backlinks from social networks like Facebook, Google plus, twitter, etc are nofollow. But you&amp;rsquo;ll be shocked to know that Google uses data from social networks to rank websites in the search engine regardless whether the link is dofollow or nofollow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone reads and article on your site and if he/she shares it in a group/page or on his public timeline, this link will be considered as a vote of trust. Thus, if your blog articles are shared 100s of time, there&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that your site will rank in the 1st 2 or 3 pages of Google. Making people share content is not a piece of cake. The user will not share your blog post unless he has a reason to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adsense program accepts websites that have quality content or very high organic search traffic. If your site doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any of these 2, instead of wasting your time in applying for Adsense account, use any of the below techniques to monetize your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve not recommended ad networks like Infolinks, Chitika, Vigilink, media.net as they pay you just one or 2 pennies for traffic from non-English speaking countries. These advertising networks demotivate bloggers due to their low payouts. Hence many bloggers quit their online careers within 5 or 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As WordPress content management system has a commenting and trackback system, it&amp;rsquo;s always on the target of spammers.

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re allowing dofollow backlinks, link juice will be transferred to the commentators website. To avoid this, install and activate the ultimate nofollow plugin on your blog. This plugin will allow you to convert all dofollow links in comments to nofollow. To block spam comments on your WordPress website, you install any of the below free plugins:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my perspective, bounce rate (BR) is one of the major search engine ranking signals for a blog. If it&amp;rsquo;s below 70, search engines like Bing, Google will love your site, and they&amp;rsquo;ll rank it higher than low-quality sites. If your site&amp;rsquo;s BR is high (above 90), it will rank low in search engines. If you&amp;rsquo;re an owner of such website, use the below strategies to reduce bounce rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-a-search-widget-in-sidebar&#34;&gt;Add a search widget in sidebar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not guys! The search bar is one of the most important elements on a blog. All top blogs in the world will have a search utility. When a visitor lands on your website and doesn&amp;rsquo;t find a relevant article, he/she will use the search utility to find a relevant article. If your blog navigation is not good, the search bar will come in rescue. If your site doesn&amp;rsquo;t have it, add a search bar immediately. You can create one for your blog with Google CSE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How i increased blog traffic from search engines (Google &amp; Bing)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Blog&amp;rsquo;s income directly depends on the number of visitors your site gets from search engines. In AdSense terms and conditions, it is clearly stated that a user should avoid all fake methods of generating traffic. Affiliate marketing doesn&amp;rsquo;t have strict terms and conditions. My blog&amp;rsquo;s traffic was down several times but I never gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started with blogging, for the first 6 to 7 months, there were just 500 to 600 visitors/month to my site. When it was affected by a penalty, the traffic dropped to 100 or 200 visitors. These stats were not enough to generate a decent income nor was I eligible for AdSense program. Now the traffic has increased more than 10 times, 50 percent of my online income is from Adsense and the rest comes from four affiliate programs. Before the year 2016 ends, I expect my blog traffic to increase over 10000 UV/day. Here are the techniques I used to improve traffic to my blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to auto generate meta description tag in WordPress blogs</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/how-to-auto-generate-meta-description-tag-in-wordpress-blogs/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/how-to-auto-generate-meta-description-tag-in-wordpress-blogs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to blogging and search engine optimization, no other on-page element is as important as title and meta descriptions. According to Google webmaster guidelines, every page on a WordPress blog must have unique meta description and title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t follow this guideline, your site won&amp;rsquo;t rank well in search engines, and if you&amp;rsquo;ve verified your blog with Google Webmaster tools, you&amp;rsquo;ll see duplicate tag warning in HTML improvements section of your GWT account. Meta description is one of the most important on-page elements as it is the first thing that a search engine users see (if your site appears in the search results) when they search for some information. If you&amp;rsquo;ve not added relevant keyword and a useful short information in this tag, the user will not visit your blog. Meta description length should not be less or more than 170 characters, and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be stuffed with keywords.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Slideshows are attractive, aren&amp;rsquo;t they? Blogs with slideshows have a very less bounce rate, high level of user engagement and better conversion rate. Many webmasters embed a picture slideshow in their sites. This makes users spend more time on the sites which in turn increases its search engine rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use an online tool to create slides, there&amp;rsquo;s no better tool than SlideShare. This tool can generate slideshow code. Thus, you can easily embed your slideshow on any blog/website. If you use this code, you will be wasting your page rank as the code will link your site to SlideShare without adding rel=&amp;ldquo;nofollow&amp;rdquo; attribute. The generated code will add an iframe to your site. Some search engines ignore the content in iframes. In such cases, you can use the best WordPress slideshow plugin, the Meta Slider. If you don&amp;rsquo;t use WordPress content management system, you can use a Jquery slideshow plugin. There are two main advantages of using the WP plugin:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to move my WordPress site from one server to another a couple of times with 0 seconds downtime and no loss of traffic. For a newbie, the transfer process can take almost an hour. For an experienced guy, the time will be reduced to 20 or 25 minutes. Migrating a WordPress site is impossible if you&amp;rsquo;re using a slow internet connection. So make sure that you&amp;rsquo;re a broadband user with a web speed of at least 1 or 2 MBPS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the 1st of April might have been the best day for you but it was an awful day for me. My top site, which generates a decent income was down for nearly 4 hours in the daytime. The site was not accessible to 100s of search engine users from 12:30 PM to 4:20 PM. The downtime was due to a network issue and misconfiguration by ASO staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network issue started around 12:30 PM and it was resolved after 45 minutes. The staff moved the affected domains to a new IP address but the mapping was not correct. So from 1:00 PM onwards, the homepage of my blog was being redirected to some shi*t site. This resulted in 100s of 404 errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reducing jpg, png file size on self-hosted WordPress blogs will not only improve its load time but it will also increase the search engine rankings of your post. Google considers site speed as a ranking factor. There are two ways to reduce picture size before uploading to your blog. Install a standalone Windows or Linux software that will resize images or use a WP plugin. The 2nd option is better than the 1st. Ever since I started blogging, I used the WP-SmushIt plugin for the same. Last night, after updating the WP-smushIt plugin, I saw a message that Yahoo would be stopping its free version of WP-smushIt service and to continue using the plugin, I have to upgrade to pro version. This made me search for a WP-smushIt alternative. After doing a bit of internet research, I ended up installing EWWW. Here&amp;rsquo;s my review for the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My technology blog was penalized at least 4 to 5 times. In my initial days of blogging career, I was not aware of terms like keyword density, on page SEO, backlinks, etc. I indulged myself in link building activities, and I was not focused on sharing top quality content. These three blogging mistakes killed my blog&amp;rsquo;s traffic up to 70 to 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they say, we learn from our mistakes and hard work pays off, I worked hard for 3 to 4 months to regain the lost traffic and rectified all errors that I committed. In those four months, I removed around 400 blog posts and improved the content quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google AdSense program can make you rich. But getting your blog or website approved for it is a challenging task. Newbie bloggers have to wait for several months before their sites get approved for Adsense ads. I had applied for 20 times. Each time I applied for Adsense, I got the rejection message stating that my blog is not eligible to participate in the program. The news was disheartening, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from submitting the application again. My site got approved on the 21st attempt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most discussed topics in SEO is backlink. Backlinks help a blog to get higher ranking in search engines. But they can be a reason for the death of your blog too. Backlinks can be created manually by the user or artificially via software. If you write a high-quality article which has unique content, your article will be referred to another website via a backlink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural links are useful, and you should avoid creating links using any other method. Google has explicitly mentioned in its webmaster guidelines that it will show no mercy on sites that participate in link exchanges, link trades, 5etc. Google&amp;rsquo;s Penguin algorithm has proven to be a sworn enemy of websites with bad link profiles. The Penguin algorithm is refreshed every 3 or 4 months. Tools such as Mozcast and algoroo can make you aware of any Google update. Today, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing the best five most powerful tools to check backlinks. These tools can generate a report on the daily, monthly or yearly basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Page load times of WordPress CMS powered blogs can decrease if webmasters start using a caching plugin. The two most widely used plugins for caching are W3TC and WordPress super cache. These 2 plugins create static HTML files from all of your blog posts and it saves these files to the cache folder on a disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress saves blog posts in database tables. When a search engine or a visitor requests it via permalink, WordPress loads the post from the database and it renders it as an HTML file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was a time when search engines like MSN, Bing, Yahoo, and Google were considered as the only source of website traffic. Now things have changed a lot. Social network sites like FB, Twitter, Google+ are used by billions of people across the world. When you have a good audience on sites like Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, Instagram, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to depend on search engines for website traffic. Blogs are probably incomplete without a social media plugin. These plugins make sharing of blog posts easier for visitors. Almost all websites (excluding social network sites) have such plugins installed on their website. Below are the three main advantages of these plugins:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our today&amp;rsquo;s article - 10 most popular blogs on the internet (2015) has been published to inspire you. As a blogger, you need inspiration. Many times, you may not be satisfied with your online career and you may think to quit blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t recommend you to do this as many months of your hard work will go in vain. Just go through the content published on the most popular blogs. Quality content has helped the best websites on the internet to rank very high in search engines. As they rank high, they get 1000&amp;rsquo;s of do-follow natural backlinks every day. The owners of these blogs are self-made millionaires and they&amp;rsquo;re an inspiration to all of us. If you&amp;rsquo;re a newbie blogger, your articles won&amp;rsquo;t rank as high as the articles found on the most popular blogs. But they&amp;rsquo;ll outrank low quality and thin websites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress and Blogger are 2 of the most popular blogging platforms/content management systems of all time. They are free to use. These 2 platforms are so powerful that users can build/launch a new website within a couple of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

After 5 - 6 months, I migrated my site to WordPress.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month, i decided to switch hosting from ******* to some other service. As there are many website hosting companies, i was confused to decide which one should I signup for. I was impressed with reviews on Hostgator, Inmotion, Bluehost and A2webhosting but I ended signing up for a small orange. ASO was suggested by some that folks have their blogs deployed on ASO servers. It has been a week since I moved my blog. I&amp;rsquo;m very satisfied with the performance of my new host. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;my review of a small orange hosting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
