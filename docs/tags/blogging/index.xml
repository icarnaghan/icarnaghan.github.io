      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those that may be unfamiliar with its meaning, the term blog comes from the combination of the words web and log. Blogs can typically consist of entries that include comments on culture, hobbies or everyday life, occasionally featuring a video or music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There are many others in this niche (ProBlogger comes to mind), but nobody really delves deeply into details and provides as much useful information as Blogussion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Version 3.0 of Inside the Webb has finally launched live.

      <title>Rumors of Yahoo! Taking Down MyBlogLog could be False</title>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/rumors-of-yahoo-taking-down-mybloglog-could-be-false/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting around December I had seen a lot of blogs posting about Yahoo! considering closing the doors on MyBlogLog. I was sad to hear this news, as I have been a huge fan of MyBlogLog since it first launched in 2005. It was a simple community of bloggers with a simple goal of uniting the best writers and bloggers on the web.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Blogging and Design Tips from Pro Blog Design Creator Michael Martin</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/blogging-and-design-tips-from-pro-blog-design-creator-michael-martin/</link>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/blogging-and-design-tips-from-pro-blog-design-creator-michael-martin/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly one of the most important aspects of running a blog is keeping up with design trends. You can write amazing articles and share the best tips on the web, but if your blog looks like a run-down 1990&amp;rsquo;s ripoff or some generic Wordpress template, chances are you won&amp;rsquo;t be attracting many visitors to your site. The most famous and successful bloggers realize how important a custom design really is, and no expenses are cut when it comes to design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finding good tutorials on web design and development can be tough these days. Although so many people have and use Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and all of the creative suite, there are very few that know how to utilize the tools properly and create astounding designs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Web designers can spend hours looking for inspiration. We&amp;rsquo;ve all been there, up at 1 in the morning trying to work out a project you&amp;rsquo;ve got lined up but nothing seems to be hitting you. Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m at a design roadblock I usually turn to typical web design blogs to get the juices flowing again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
