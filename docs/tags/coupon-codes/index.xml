      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coupon websites can be very profitable if you bring traffic to it. For example, RetailmeNot consistently earns over 100 million dollars in revenue it has millions of monthly unique visitors. It is nothing but a well-designed coupon site. Coupon Raja was bought by one of the India&amp;rsquo;s largest media hours, i.e., Times Group. Before being purchased, it had reported over five crores of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such sites, you will find short posts with an affiliate link to eCommerce portal or any other service. This post includes rating, code, social sharing links, and a small description. When the user clicks on your link and makes a purchase from the affiliate, you&amp;rsquo;ll earn a commission. By the month end, you&amp;rsquo;ll receive payment via cheque, PayPal or net banking. All affiliate account include a dashboard where you can find details on the clicks, conversion rate, returns, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month, i decided to switch hosting from ******* to some other service. As there are many website hosting companies, i was confused to decide which one should I signup for. I was impressed with reviews on Hostgator, Inmotion, Bluehost and A2webhosting but I ended signing up for a small orange. ASO was suggested by some that folks have their blogs deployed on ASO servers. It has been a week since I moved my blog. I&amp;rsquo;m very satisfied with the performance of my new host. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;my review of a small orange hosting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
