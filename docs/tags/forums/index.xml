      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of all the internet marketing and blogging forums out there, Digital Point was the first community I ever joined. I&amp;rsquo;ve been there for years, learned so much from the members and even contributed to helping others along their path. There are many other choices, but DP will always hold a special place in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of running the same design, DP has finally upgraded to a fresh web 2.0 look and feel to the entire site! Now running what is clearly the latest version of vBulletin 4.0 Forum Software, the latest design really kicks new life into such an expansive and helpful community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
