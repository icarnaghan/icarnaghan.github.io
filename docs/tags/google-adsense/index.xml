      <description>&lt;p&gt;Blogging and Vlogging are two sides of the same coin. Many people employ these two methods to earn money online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In blogging, you start a new website and publish reviews and details of your favorite products, tips, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vlogging, you ask someone to record your video or if you&amp;rsquo;re publishing a video tutorial, you use a screen recorder tool to capture the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, I have shared a detailed comparison of Blogging and Vlogging. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking forward to pursuing a career in Vlogging or Blogging, my comparison will clear your doubts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People join affiliate programs or signup for AdSense to earn money online. In case you&amp;rsquo;re wondering which monetization technique you should implement on your blog, go through the following 6 to 7 paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adsense-or-affiliate-marketing--which-is-better&#34;&gt;AdSense or Affiliate Marketing : Which is better?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AdSense is the world&amp;rsquo;s best CPC network. It has the highest CPC rates. AdWords is the backbone of AdSense. It has a large number of advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you become a part of AdSense program, you have to place an ad code on your website in accordance with the AdSense terms and conditions. You can get the ad code from your AdSense dashboard. AdSense provides various types of ad formats&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best AdSense alternatives to earn dollars not cents (2018)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AdSense is a great platform for making money online. But getting approved for it or having a five or six figure AdSense revenue is a difficult task. People have a misunderstanding that GA is the only advertiser with which they can make them rich. They are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is predictable in the world of internet. Hence, you should always try out different strategies for maximizing revenue from the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many methods of monetizing a website. This is what I have learned from my 3 years of experience as a blogger. People make a mistake by depending only on AdSense aka a single source for their earnings. They don&amp;rsquo;t experiment with other monetization programs aka AdSense alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pay per click advertisement platforms is the best way to monetize a blog. When it comes to the best PPC networks, nothing beats Google Adsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA is the most widely used PPC platform. It has 10 to 100 times better CPC rates than Chitika, InFolinks, Bidvertiser, etc. Thus, your first monetization option should always be Adsense. If your AdSense application gets disapproved, you should make your website better before resubmitting the application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/advanced-ads-is-powerful-plugin-to-insert-and-manage-adverts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I felt the need to install a new third party plugin for inserting advertisements to my blog. My favorite plugin i.e. Quick Adsense has not been updated for over 1.5 years, and it has become unreliable because it has not been tested with latest WordPress versions. I searched the WordPress repository to find a reliable and frequently updated plugin for insert adverts. After a few minutes, I found Advanced ads. I was tempted to try out the plugin after going through its ratings and reviews shared by the real users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you own an AdSense account, it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to safeguard it. Many accounts get banned every day because they take AdSense program lightly. There are two ways you can keep your account safe i.e., avoid clicking on your ads and report invalid activity to Google. The 1st method is easy to follow because you just have to install an ad blocker plugin on your browser. The browser will prevent ads from loading on websites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adsense is one of the best platforms to earn money online, but not everyone is successful with it. Some bloggers make 500+ dollars per month just with AdSense and others have to satisfy themselves with just 50 or 100 USD. If people use black hat methods and cheat Google, their accounts are banned immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to cheat, nor you have to waste time in using websites that claim to increase your ad revenue. If you work smartly and hard, your Adsense income will increase. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll share some effective tips and strategies that will help you to earn more cash with Google&amp;rsquo;s publisher program.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Killer ways to make money without AdSense (2018)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adsense program accepts websites that have quality content or very high organic search traffic. If your site doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any of these 2, instead of wasting your time in applying for Adsense account, use any of the below techniques to monetize your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve not recommended ad networks like Infolinks, Chitika, Vigilink, media.net as they pay you just one or 2 pennies for traffic from non-English speaking countries. These advertising networks demotivate bloggers due to their low payouts. Hence many bloggers quit their online careers within 5 or 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Professional bloggers are successful because they make wise use of SEO tools. For example, Pat Flynn, the owner of smart passive income has launched a few niche blogs that earn him over 5000 dollars every month. Patt is one of the most intelligent bloggers in the world. He makes more than 50000 dollars every month by promoting various products. He makes use of different keyword research tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amit Agarwal, the top Indian blogger, initially used Google Keyword Planner to find relevant and high traffic keywords, as a result, his blog labnol generates more 2.5 million INR revenue through AdSense. Most of the articles on his site labnol.org rank on 1st page of Google.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Key reasons why Google adsense application gets disapproved</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/key-reasons-why-google-adsense-application-gets-disapproved/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/key-reasons-why-google-adsense-application-gets-disapproved/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google AdSense program can make you rich. But getting your blog or website approved for it is a challenging task. Newbie bloggers have to wait for several months before their sites get approved for Adsense ads. I had applied for 20 times. Each time I applied for Adsense, I got the rejection message stating that my blog is not eligible to participate in the program. The news was disheartening, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from submitting the application again. My site got approved on the 21st attempt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
