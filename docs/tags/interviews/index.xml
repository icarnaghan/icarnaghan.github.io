      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a huge fan of blogs, namely up and coming stars. Blogussion caught my eye a few months ago, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been following their articles ever since. Jam-packed with blogging and internet traffic-related SEO articles, Blogussion is one of the top blogging resources on the web today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the freelance and web design/development community for years now, starting back when I was attending high school. I always keep up with the latest blogs, tutorials, tips, and design tricks from the community, and no blog has shown greater content with a higher rate of growth than Six Revisions. Jacob Gube is the founder and main writer at the blog, and I&amp;rsquo;m lucky enough to share with you some great Q&amp;amp;A&amp;rsquo;s between us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So many design blogs and showcases today are giving away icons for free. Even in large sets, social media icons and small graphics are making their way into the big time. I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of collecting icons, and all of these free sites are extremely useful and always in my bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PSD Conversion is a very high-paying business. Many amazing designers know how to work through Photoshop but just don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or haven&amp;rsquo;t learned how to code their designs into XHTML and CSS code. This is where many popular companies come in to help, the most popular being psd2html.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

LogoMoose makes it to the top of my list.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Answers has to be the most well-known and popular Question &amp;amp; Community on the web. However there is always room for improvement on apps like these, and Blurtit takes the cake. Building more of a community around the idea of the &amp;ldquo;Ask Any Question&amp;rdquo; niche, Blurtit allows users to connect like never before, searching for the most popular questions and sharing knowledge between everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Blogging and Design Tips from Pro Blog Design Creator Michael Martin</title>
      <link>https://www.carnaghan.com/blogging-and-design-tips-from-pro-blog-design-creator-michael-martin/</link>

      <guid>https://www.carnaghan.com/blogging-and-design-tips-from-pro-blog-design-creator-michael-martin/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly one of the most important aspects of running a blog is keeping up with design trends. You can write amazing articles and share the best tips on the web, but if your blog looks like a run-down 1990&amp;rsquo;s ripoff or some generic Wordpress template, chances are you won&amp;rsquo;t be attracting many visitors to your site. The most famous and successful bloggers realize how important a custom design really is, and no expenses are cut when it comes to design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a web designer myself, I have found that other web designers I talk to always have favorite websites they go to for inspiration. Not saying they want to copy a specific website, but there are just some site&amp;rsquo;s that &amp;ldquo;stick&amp;rdquo; and really inspire you to create web designs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
