      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I found out about Grooveshark a few months ago, it&amp;rsquo;s revolutionized the way I listen to music. No longer am I stuck with my iTunes playlists and limitions on songs - nor do I even need to store the songs on my computer!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being able to carry your music library on an iPod or MP3 player has revolutionized how we listen to music. It&amp;rsquo;s allowed us to bring our favorite songs anywhere we go, keep us busy when waiting on appointments, and share some of our favorite music with friends. However, with MeCanto you can now bring your entire music library anywhere you can get an internet collection - that&amp;rsquo;s practically anywhere!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
