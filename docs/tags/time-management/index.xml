      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I found another cool app the other day. plan.fm, simple name with a simple purpose of uniting all of your plans in one place. You can draw in feeds from social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter and merge your plans all into one calendar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sharing files over the internet used to be a devilish task. Finding the right application, storage space, or transporation method for files used to be very difficult only 5 years ago. Now with file upload sites and forums/bulletin boards to share files, sending your friend a song or posting up a funny picture has never been easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently been scoping out some cool web 2.0 sites to add to my blog for my first interview, and I found my answer lying in the new startup task.fm. This app has only been online for about a week so far, but already has a booming userbase of 1000 regular users and growing daily. Task.fm allows its users to have reminders sent through e-mail, phone, and SMS. The reminders can be entered by the user, and typed in regular speech, too! Below is my interview with the site&amp;rsquo;s creator Anthony Feint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
