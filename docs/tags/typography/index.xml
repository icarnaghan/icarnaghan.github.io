      <description>&lt;p&gt;The font is one of the most critical elements on a website. Developers make sure that the typography of their website is best in class. If your visitor finds that your site is ugly, he&amp;rsquo;ll leave it immediately without reading the content or making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 100s of fonts that you can use for free, but you will have to spend a lot of time in searching for them unless you use Google web fonts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
