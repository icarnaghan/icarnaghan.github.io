      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges of having a long commute to work is finding new and interesting ways to make the morning and evening drives more interesting. Over the last year I have found the perfect answer by subscribing to podcasts that I am interested in, which have also served to advance my own personal development and education.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back a few years ago I used to work full-time freelance web design. It&amp;rsquo;s a tiring job, and many people who can do it today earn a lot of money working for themselves in the trade. Web professionals are always in demand, but it&amp;rsquo;s difficult at times to find good web projects. Freshwebjobs.com changes all that with professional listings to pair up webmasters and developers to those looking into projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PSD Conversion is a very high-paying business. Many amazing designers know how to work through Photoshop but just don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or haven&amp;rsquo;t learned how to code their designs into XHTML and CSS code. This is where many popular companies come in to help, the most popular being psd2html.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So many premium Wordpress themes roam the internet these days, all of varying quality and development. I recently found a really neat Premium Wordpress design company WP Monk. They run a very impressive website design, plus their premium themes are impeccable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a web designer myself, I have found that other web designers I talk to always have favorite websites they go to for inspiration. Not saying they want to copy a specific website, but there are just some site&amp;rsquo;s that &amp;ldquo;stick&amp;rdquo; and really inspire you to create web designs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finding a decent web hosting company today is difficult. So many companies overprice, can&amp;rsquo;t keep uptime promises, have horrible support, or offer you barely any space to store your site&amp;rsquo;s files and content. The few that have shown promise in the past are some of my favorites: Hostgator, Dreamhost, Bluehost, etc. However as I was browsing the web one night (like always) I ran into a great looking hosting company, This*.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
