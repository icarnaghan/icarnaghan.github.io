Crawler bots, like human users, appreciate sites which have clear, structured, readable data. However, since crawlers can only spend a limited amount of time and resources per site, domains with incoherent site maps, broken links, or 404 errors might not get indexed at all, effectively invisibilizing it for all potential users.

Its name offers an insight into how OOP languages work, which is by revolving around objects and using objects to get things done. The term object refers to a chunk of code that acts together as a whole and can be reused at any time, as well as interact with other objects. Some of the very basic elements of OOP include objects, classes and methods. Object-oriented programming works in a way that enables programmers to reuse their code and use it in multiple different instances, without having to write the code all over again.

Arrow functions have quickly become the standard way of writing functions among professional JavaScript developers. Because they are so widespread, it’s essential for every JavaScript programmer to understand arrow functions - what they are, how to write them, and how they are different from ordinary functions.

Closures is certainly one of those areas that has caused me to review and experiment with several times. The purpose of this article is to provide a succinct overview of closures and offer several snippets of code to play around with in order to better understand this often tricky to grasp concept. Consciously or Unconsciously, most developers use closures while programming in JavaScript. Most of the time, everything works fine, but it is always better to understand how they work as they provide better control over your code. Moreover, at some point you might be asked to explain what closures are and hopefully by the end of this you will be in a much better position to do that. So let’s start with what a closure is. A simplified explanation would be that a closure is an inner function that has access to the variables of the outer function. This is called the scope chain. See my earlier article on JavaScript Scope if you need a refresher.

But before you dive right into the heuristics evaluation of the website, you need to be aware of what it is and how you can conduct it with precision. Take some time and learn about all the ins and outs of the technique.

The content below is what I have used to better prepare for this domain. Before reviewing this section, if you haven’t already taken Kelly Handerhan’s CISSP course, I would highly recommend spending some time going through it. It is by far the most engaging and relevant video series I’ve seen for CISSP study prep. In the first domain she covers a slide called the tenants of secure design, which is also very relevant here. At a minimum, make sure you are familiar with concepts she covers here including risk analysis, defense in depth, fail safe, KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid), completeness of design, open design, redundancy, separation of duties, mandatory vacations, job rotation, and others.

One thing you probably learned was that if you wanted to play games, one way was to buy computer magazines at the bookstore and type in published source code. If you’re like some people, you learned a few things about programming from typing in those games, and went on to write your own. ...</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2019-09-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 2, 2019</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;831 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;icarnaghan</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Learning to Program in TIC-80, a Fantasy Console" href=https://www.carnaghan.com/learning-to-program-in-tic-80-a-fantasy-console/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Modern Design Approaches, Frameworks and Resources</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Over the last few years, several web design trends have exploded in popularity and different frameworks and libraries have emerged to support them. It’s been close to a decade since the term ‘responsive’ became mainstream and changed our way of thinking about the structure of our applications across devices. Since that time other design philosophies have followed as we sought ways to improve the user experience across a diverse range of platforms. At the same time tools and techniques have continued to improve to arm designers with the right frameworks, libraries and approaches to deliver the best user experiences possible. In this article I will cover some of the more popular design approaches and libraries that can be used to implement them. I’ll conclude with a quick list of several wireframing tools that can also be used in design. I recommend checking out each of these resources via the links provided below.

Nagesh & Cody (2005) provide an overview of these contrasting approaches, which are vastly different with their own merits and downsides. Inmon believes in building a large centralized enterprise-wide data warehouse using a relational database. Kimball on the other hand recommends starting by defining data marts (subsets of data around a specific domain, or use case) within a star schema. In order to understand these approaches, it is essential to understand the main differences between a relational model and a star model.
