It was the good old days you would say the nostalgia of his adventures on the Megadrive. Today, his platform of choice is the Nintendo Wii and its controls to the Wiimote air. A search from noon to fourteen hours, if the blue hedgehog explores the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, it is only a pretext for a gigantic sword that it leads to Using the remote control. For the rest, the gameplay of the previous component is included, since it always leads Sonic in a sort of corridor using the Nunchuk. The game is in 3D, and rather pretty, but when we want to go back, the hedgehog is the moonwalk idling. As in Secret Rings, it is impossible to turn back. We regret a bit of Sonic Adventure for the Dreamcast console. Even if we admit that this game forces us to move forward by taking advantage of the speed of this oh so endearing character.

After a through enough portage in episodes 2 and 3, the Wii will finally host an original and jubilant forthcoming opus.
At the outset, the fans can rest assured, the unique atmosphere of The House of the Dead has been preserved. Bad taste, humor at twenty cents, torrents of hemoglobin, the Sega team has worked hard to restore the atmosphere of horror cinema of the 60s. The image is deliberately patina, the soundtrack evokes the films “Pulp” dear to the heart of Tarantino and just take a look under the letter written in levels of blood (“Papa’s Palace of Pain," “Scream Train… “) to understand that the script never takes itself too seriously. Chronologically situated before the original episode, it is far from devoid the interest since we propose to follow the beginning of the famous Agent G and his sidekick, Issac Washington. The opportunity to try to learn more about one of the most enigmatic characters in the series.

Scheduled for March 5th, Tenchu Shadow Assassins has the honor of a preview after what it achieved at the last Tokyo Game Show. The result seems always so convincing? This is the question that the following attempt to answer.
The first strong point of the game is to return to a more classical style than Tenchu Z which included creating your own ninja. A point of creation but the possibility to find the cheap Rikimaru and Ayame adorable. Originality, it is very nice because we don’t face a narrative echoing like those of the other episodes but on the contrary, the pleasure of the reunion is indeed real. In addition, it helps to consolidate a mythology implementation that is over 10 years old. It will therefore not be surprised to find Lord Goda, for who the knights of the shadow work, or the princess Kiku who don’t find anything better than to be kidnapped early in the game.
