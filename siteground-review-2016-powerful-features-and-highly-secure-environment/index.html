With SG, you will never experience such issues because the infrastructure of Siteground hosting company is good.\nThe great thing about site ground is that you’ve to pay for the resource you use. For example, the cheapest hosting plan, i.e., startup costs around 4 dollars, and it is suitable for sites with 10000 visitors per month. This plan comes with a limitation that you can host a single domain with it.\nIf your blog is getting 25k visitors per month, Siteground has a special 5.95 dollars GrowBig plan for you. For growing blogs with less than 100K visitors, there’s a powerful 11.9 USD GoGeek plan. GrowBig and GoGeek can be used to deploy more than one websites.\nCheck full details and features of siteGround hosting plans here.\nSiteground allows you to configure CloudFlare, the best free CDN service provider from the Cpanel. CF CDN will reduce the load on your server as it can cache your entire website.\nSG gives you a domain name for free when you sign up for any of their plans mentioned above. Thus, if you’re beginning your online career, Siteground is a good option to consider.\nThis website hosting service includes 30 days money back guarantee. Whether it’s daytime or night, SG support team will always be ready to help you. If you want help, just raise a ticket or use the live chat system to get in touch with the technical support expert. For immediate help, you can contact Siteground using a phone.\nSupport is one of the most important points to consider while buying a hosting plan and SG scores 4.5 out of 5 in this.\nSiteground Hosting offers a GrowBig plan that costs 5 dollar ships with a free SSL certificate. To make your blog blazing fast, it also includes a super cache module.\nThe GoGeek plan offers all the above features and its servers host fewer accounts. Its hardware is much more powerful (advanced).

The CPanel is well designed and you can easily upgrade your hosting plan with it.\nYou’re allowed to log into the server using SSH protocol. If you are an advanced Linux user, this is a useful feature as you can monitor logs, check which processes are using a lot of RAM, CPU, etc.\nSiteground has many datacenters. Thus their servers are located in different parts of the world. While buying a hosting service from them, you will be prompted to choose a location where you want to deploy the site. Always choose a location which is nearby to the country from which your blog gets maximum visitors.\nSiteground servers are secure. They come loaded with anti-spam systems.
