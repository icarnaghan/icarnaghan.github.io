The Early Banking System Since the early days of banking, the industry has faced many changes in regulation due to different needs arising throughout the years. In the early days, government control was not favored among most of the original settlers who had come from countries where too much federal control was exerted. Therefore the early banking system comprised of a multitude of different small banks printing their own currency, which would often fail and leave customers with lost funds.

It is therefore vital that business objectives be clearly established and that visa planning occurs as early as possible to ensure a smooth process of employment. There are many ways that foreign citizens can apply for residence to the United States; however, the focus of this research paper is on obtaining a work visa through organizational sponsorship and does not outline immigration-visas or ‘green cards’.

This paper will look at the two main areas of leadership and team working as I learned a great deal while working there. The main Information Technology department comprised of a Systems Manager with three main Network Managers working for him and staff working under the database managers for various computing related jobs. To give an idea of the responsibilities of the staff within the computing department I will list briefly what each position has entailed.

It will attempt to show how the benefits for and the objectives against the European Social Chapter affect social space within various countries in the European Union.
EUROPEAN SOCIAL SPACE The idea behind social space within the European Union has highlighted certain areas of concern within countries of the European Union. Employment, industrial health, social costs of industry, labour mobility and social spending within these countries are all elements dealt within European Social Space. Social space also involves education, training, housing and health. Over recent years the issues of social welfare have become extremely important as the EU has grown. One of the main reasons for this is that public expectations have increased rapidly that their governments will play a major role in improving overall quality of life, bringing social affairs firmly into the public domain. It is only over recent years that the idea of Social Space within the European Union has become a vital factor to the expansion of the EC.

MANPOWER PLANNING The main reason the process of manpower planning came about was to help the management of employees within a business organization. Manpower planning looks at the organizations current and future need of labour within the business. The current and future employment needs are a great concern and the examination of supply within the local area for possible new employees if required.
